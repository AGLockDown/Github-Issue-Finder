APP类项目的几项选择
https://github.com/mayinghua/SJTU_SoftwareEngineering/issues/35
Unsolved
同学们的项目中有好几个都可能做成app。app首先要确定是否需要有服务器端。如果没有，那么开发较为简单，数据可保存本地（java自带sqlite轻量数据库）。android平台上用java，可选用eclipse或者android Studio。后者运行速度快些，前者更老牌，二者都提供图形化开发界面，常见的界面均可实现。如果你对界面有更高的要求，那么需要对代码进行定制。
如果需要有服务器端（数据保存在服务器端），那么app的开发有另一条道路，就是HTML5，这是新的一个网页标准，对图形支持好。大家平时看到的一些手机版的网站大都是html5开发的。同样支持按钮等，当然不同的是，所有的运算都放在web服务器上了。
如果对界面要求非常高，控件用得少，图片用得多，可以使用cocos框架等游戏编程框架（很多种，可调研一下）。cocos这个框架是C++的，可以集成到visual studio等开发环境中。去年有同学用它开发可视化程序，开发效率高。它直接支持对png等图片的处理，因此整个界面都是各类图片的移动、添加、删除等操作。该框架虽然主要用于游戏，但也可以用于普通人机界面。
选用框架进行编程，需要专门安排时间来进行框架的学习。磨刀不误砍柴工。因此，框架的选用也应该花些时间来考虑它的主要功能，应用场景，框架的维护是否持续，应用用户是否足够多，帮助文档是否全面，学习难度如何，是否适用于自己的项目等等。

This is a discussion issue where we are inviting all contributors (existing and potential) to bring forth Software Daily Project pain points as well as ideas to address them. These can apply to any of the repos but I've created it here as this is the most active repo.
Pain points are anything that creates friction in your ability to contribute to the Project. It could mostly affect part time volunteers, core maintainers, or both. After some time we can put together a plan to implement solutions to the most significant or common pain points.

Hello,
I am starting new to this project. I was able to get it running using docker-compose, but honestly I have no idea where to get started from there on. I have tried to read Backend-GettingStarted - not much of a guide.
Am I missing something? I started reading some code, and found where are swagger documentation. /api/docs.
Can we add some documentation around application architecture for good place to start? I would work on writing this, but I don't understand it myself at the moment.

Better and more consistent approach to env config
https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/software-engineering-daily-api/issues/238
Unsolved
As referenced in #231 - there are too many items in /config/config.js that are required env variables but only really relevant to production, (maybe) staging, and for specific devs working on those features. These are those related to external services - Stripe, Mail Chimp, etc. They're not relevant to CI and for most devs doing core app work.
I also noticed when starting to look at this that we are not fully consistent in how we many env variables. For example, MAILCHIMP_KEY is defined and accessed via /config/config.js while STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY is accessed via process.env - so there may be an opportunity to be a bit more consistent.
Before putting in a PR - was looking for some input on best option to organize from @jasonify and @andrewmarklloyd. @abdulbasitkay - your input would also be appreciated and I'm pretty sure this is relevant to the work related to Cloud9 you're starting to look into.
Define everything through /config/config.js. Make external service variables optional (MAILCHIMP_KEY, etc).
Strip down /config/config.js to only those items that are core to the app, for external services use process.env (what we are already doing with Stripe and AWS)
My preference is option 1 as it would be more explicit and overall more consistent but I'm open to either. For option 1 in Joi we can make the optional items simple optional() or use a fake key default like default('mailchimp_key-us6'). I think the later would be best.
I'm also not sure why we have a separate .env.docker_example. I think this and .env.local_example can be removed and we can just use a .env.example.

Add better error reporting to event stream
https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/software-engineering-daily-api/issues/225
Unsolved
@tyler-furby @abdulbasitkay @jasonify @joshmorel I'm looking into better error reporting for the API. Currently it's up to each controller (or any class) to use the sendError helper. Here's an example usage. What if instead we abstracted it to the APIError.js class itself? So instead of every time a class creates the APIError and has to also use the sendError helper, what if the APIError just sent the error to the event stream instead?

We need an API for getting a user's listened history. I'm not sure where the listen data is stored (InfluxDB, Firebase?) but it is definitely not easily accessible.
Once we have that API, it will be much easier to build:
a custom recommendation system (we should probably replace our Raccoon powered one eventually)
the ability to serve related links to people
other collaborative filtering related features (connecting users who listen to similar material)

List is very US-centric

Unsolved
I count just 11 companies out of the 382 listed that have offices in the UK (bias: I live there), 21 offer remote working arrangements. Not all programmers live in California, you know ;)
Suggestion: split up the list by country - this will also allow greater specificity within the location field. Yes, multi-location companies may have to be repeated, but I think it would still be more searchable that way. This also instantly helps people narrow down their choices to countries they can easily obtain right to work in (ie. EU nationals can move to another EU country (exception: countries that shot themselves in the foot, like the UK) and just start work there, but moving to California requires a green card or H1B (is that what it's called?)).

Is mips64 supported enough to get callgraph and (more important) inject code into basic blocks? Tried to play around with elf for mips64 with octeon specific instructions (I've added them) with no luck - eresi detects only 2 functions, upon disassembling covers only a small part of binary (I haven't found out the exact reason yet). It seems like a problem with basic block / function identification maybe.

Consider integration with radare2 framework
https://github.com/thorkill/eresi/issues/151
Unsolved
ERESI was awesome, and I see activity now here, I hope you'll revive development again.
But what I suggesting - is to think about integration with radare2 framework for those tasks, that already implemented in r2. And you can support more debugging features through r2 too. Keep in mind, that r2 doesn't have external dependencies and already support bunch of architectures and debuggers.

e2dbg fails to intercept call to exit_group() at process exit
https://github.com/thorkill/eresi/issues/121
Unsolved
When debugging a program with e2dbg, and that program finishes with a exit_group(), the debugger fails to catch the process exit, and it is necessary to do ctrl-c to quit the debugger.
e2dbg should be able to detect the process exit and end the debugging session gracefully.

Well, everything is already in the title.
The prompt of e2dbg is removed after too many backspace, and only show it again. This is not a big bug but it can mislead users to think that e2dbg has crashed since it appears not responding until you show the prompt again.

readmema and writemem handlers should check input address mapping
https://github.com/thorkill/eresi/issues/93
Unsolved
The vectors "readmema" and "writemem" will in certain conditions read or write to an invalid address, leading to a segmentation fault when in e2dbg. Other programs seems immune against this error, so only elfsh_get_raw_by_addr() seem to be affected.
Many commands seems to be affected by that bug, D, X, write in particular.
In practice, for example:
The "write" command, when in debug mode, will not check if the address provided is really mapped. It will directly write to it. Its not straightforward to do that test, but I can think of 2 solutions:
look in the linkmap if the addr is part of a mapped object (but the stack and the heap are maybe not part of the linkmap ? to verify...)
handle the SIGSEGV and print "address not mapped" in the handler, so we could report the problem and continue the execution as if nothing had happened, obviously without doing the write.

Only allow specific errors in notebooks
https://github.com/UCL/rsd-engineeringcourse/issues/121
Unsolved
Some of the notebooks contain cells that intentionally cause errors, which breaks the execution. We are currently running nbconvert --allow-errors to continue the conversion after an error occurs, but this means we are potentially letting other errors through without noticing (there doesn't seem to be a way to get all the errors raised).
Version 5.4 of nbconvert has support for the raises-exception tag, which lets you specify that a particular cell is expected to produce an error, and shouldn't stop the conversion if an exception is raised (there is an issue open for the inverse, requiring that the cell produces the error, and stopping the conversion if it doesn't). If we use that, then we should be able to just run nbconvert and only accept the errors we have put there intentionally.

Iterators and Generators page
https://github.com/UCL/rsd-engineeringcourse/issues/115
Unsolved
We see iter(), __iter__(), next and __next__(). This is inconsistent. Is this due to notebook mark-up errors?
It says # See future NumPy lecture for using reshape, but was that not in a previous lecture?
In A shortcut to iterables: the iter method section, where is __iter__() called? I don't get this.
Typo in "and return an something iterable." (an)
The code says "@repeater(3)". Can we do this because we earlier defined a repeater() function? EDIT: ah I see further down this is indeed the case. But we should make this clear.
Typo def assert_examplar should say def assert_exemplar
On the same piece of code it would help if we could see an example of it being used to make things clearer.
In def test_greeter(), there is a superfluous bracket in ) as fixtures_file:
I don't really understand this code. And what does **fixture mean?
In Negative test contexts managers section, we should show the output seen by running the code straight after "We have seen this:"
My head was spinning by the time I got to def homemade_raises_decorator. I'm not sure I understand it. Then again, maybe people just need to know how to use these things without understanding all the details??!!

The %matplotlib inline should go at the start of "Strategy pattern example: sunspots". Remove from line above and also from line below.
Typo: unweildy should be unwieldy
In "Apply the strategy pattern", which is already quite confusing, why do we show the traceback?

In code snippet self.position+= self.velocity*delta_t the C++ code makes clear that delta_t is a single quantity (double) rather than a list. That suggests the bird is flying at the same speed in all 3 directions; would it not be better to have a triple of speeds to comprise the velocity list, so they can be different in different axes? Or have I misunderstood?
YUML diagram link needs to end with a ].
In "Property accessors" section, get_married() method disappears from new version.
"Using Objects doesn't mean your code is object-oriented." Is that a fair comment?
In "Inheritance in python", maybe add a Starling class with a flee() method, to show that we can have multiple different classes inheriting from the same parent. (This is indeed seen in the UML diagram a little further down).
In same block we should say that a child class extends a parent class (adds functionality) (usually) and that a parent class can be used to abstract common behaviour. Plus use of the terms "parent" and "child" should be introduced.
Typo in "Aggregation vs Inheritance" section: overal should be overall.
"Refactoring to inheritance" section: People are not Animals. Replace Animal class with LivingBeing class.
Wikipedia article on duck typing says this term is synonymous with dynamic binding; if so, the latter term should be used.
"Interfaces and concepts" section. It would be better to reword "Classes which define these methods, which cannot be instantiated into actual objects..." as "Classes which define these methods, but which cannot be instantiated into actual objects..." as not all classes with virtual methods cannot be instantiated in C++.

I don't have the tree command on my machine so I'm not sure what it does.
One line says:
from greetings.greeter import greet
but all we had on the last page was greeter.py; there wasn't a greet() function. Is that why we are seeing tracebacks? If so that seems rather pointless.
The greet() function appears further down in the page. Again this is pointless.
Need to explain:
from .greeter import greet # Note python 3 relative import
Need to explain entry points code
In summary I think this page needs a lot of work/rewriting

upvote/downvote score display is confusing/inconsistent
https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/sedaily-front-end/issues/535
Unsolved
I came across this while trying to finish the manual testing checklist with Cypress e2e tests. I do recall discussing in Slack that the default of 1 score was a bit confusing but let it be as. The problem here is that it is also inconsistent. The displayed score will drop from 1 to -1 when the backend score drops from -1 to -2.
This has to do with the JS expression in src/components/VotingArrows.vue: <div class='score-text'>{{ score + 1 || 1}}</div>. If score = -1, score + 1 is 0 or falsy so it will display 1. But if it's -1 it's truthy so will display -1.
Based on how the app is use this is super low priority but I'm going to test the voting different in Cypress until the expected behaviour is clarified. @tyler-furby - What was the original intent around this change?

Insert labels and search to filter forum content

Unsolved
Idea: mimic the look of github labels like "good first issue" "bug" only make those "projects"; "episode discussion"; "questions" etc buttons at the top of the forum posts list, so we can filter and see just one category if we want, instead of the endless scroll.
Also: add search functionality to forum, or include forum search results in softwaredaily.com overall search results.

This is a fairly small tweak for the UI and I'm not sure if this has been suggested before...

Related Links Gamification
https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/sedaily-front-end/issues/482
Unsolved
We would like to encourage people to add more related links to the episodes. This will create a durable knowledge resource around the episodes.
If we also add the related links that a user posts to that user's profile, it could create an interesting history of what that user has been reading/sharing (sort of like how it used to be cool to scroll through someone's Facebook wall to find interesting links they had shared).
I'd love some ideas around how to gamify this.

You are checking the wrong values for the green and blue specs.

Problem while installing Plugins
https://github.com/istlab/Alitheia-Core/issues/6
Unsolved
Playing around with Alitheia-Core, getting the source code, importing it to Eclipse and so on, while I executed alitheia core (through m2e mvn pax:provision), it could't install the plugin at Plugin tab. The message I got was:
ERROR - No plug-in implements metric Wc.loc which is required by Module size metrics
ERROR - Plug-in installation failed.
After making a clean install and changing the default DB to MySql and running from cmd I keept getting the same problem. Performing two or more restart, then it started to install the plugins (I verified it in MySql), however the problem was occasionally appearing, after that. Below is a snapshot of the logs at the moment the problem was happening:

EDIT: Probably this is not an Alitheia-Core issue. After looking at the code, I see that, when installing a metric plugin, if that plugin has a dependency declared at annotation level (@MetricDecl) than the dependency must be installed first. However, I think there is no way how can user understand which module requires which, in our case we can see it by the code, at least I didn't find any.

Type gr.aueb.metrics.findbugsscala cannot be resolved to a type
https://github.com/istlab/Alitheia-Core/issues/3
Unsolved
I encounter the following problem after importing Alitheia in Eclipse as a maven project.
(The alitheia version is the latest one, where the ArtifactID Eclipse problem has been resolved)
Description: gr.aueb.metrics.findbugsscala cannot be resolved to a type
Resource: Activator.java
Path: /findbugs/src/main/java/gr/aueb/metrics/findbugs
Location: line 49
I also noticed that the path /findbugs/src/main/java/gr/aueb/metrics/findbugs is from the module metrics which is not a Java project in eclipse as you can see in the attached image. So probably this is the problem. Eclipse cannot refer to a Class in the workspace with the class not being inside a Java Project

Hi, this is a really cool project! However, I'd really like to see some kind of a table of contents pointing to the single chapters. Rights now the only option I have when I'm looking for something or want to know what topics are covered, is to click on every single folder in the code folder in order to find out what is in there. And there are many of them and the names don't reflect the contents at all.

Message?
What is the chapter's clear and approachable take away message?
Researchers should match defect reports with code changes with the releases in their predictive analytics (defect prediction) models.
Accessible?
Is the chapters written for a generalist audience (no excessive use of technical terminology) with a minimum of diagrams and references? How can it be made more accessible to generalist?
The authors use lots of terms such as trunk, version control system, post release defects that may not be understood by a generalist. They may consider starting the paper with an example that would make it easier to understand by a general audience.
Size?
Is the chapter the right length? Should anything missing be added? Can anything superfluous be removed (e.g. by deleting some section that does not work so well or by using less jargon, less formulae, lees diagrams, less references).? What are the aspects of the chapter that authors SHOULD change?
The size of the chapter is right.
Gotta Mantra?
We encouraged (but did not require) the chapter title to be a mantra or something cute/catchy, i.e., some slogan reflecting best practice for data science for SE? If you have suggestion for a better title, please put them here.
The current title suggests to get take-home message from the paper, however the authors really discuss the impact of release process in software analytics, therefore they may consider an alternative title: “How the Release Process Impacts your Software Analytics”

I believe the size of the paper is good and there is not any futile information that should be deleted. I would like to add one issue to what authors mentioned:
The authors suggest capturing some data such as developer face as the task is performed. And then they mentioned some issues: Another important issue is the cost of capturing data. I believe there should be a cost/ benefit analysis on data gathering as well. the mandatory perspectives must be determined.
The authors also gave an example about how software developers learn commands available in an integrated development environment. I am not sure how did they capture the learning curve of the developers. It would be useful to clarify how knowing what were the windows active on the screen would help them to get the context in which the commands was executed.

Review of "Open from the Beginning" by Earl Barr

Review
Title of chapter
Open from the Beginning
URL to the chapter
https://github.com/ds4se/chapters/tree/master/gousiosg/open-from-the-beginning.md
Message?
What is the chapter's clear and approachable take away message?
Just like research papers, data and tooling should be open from the beginning.
Accessible?
This paper is accessible to the generalist.
Size?
This chapter is the right length.
What are the aspects of the chapter that authors SHOULD change?
I, for one, would be interested in reading more technical details about Alitheia and GHTorrent. I am curious to see if I agree with Georgios contention that openness per se is the main reason for the uptake of GHTorrent. Perhaps the tooling used to build GHTorrent is more popular? Georgios writes that GHTorrent grew with its users: this observation would be strengthened if he stated how many external patches, if any, he accepted.
How does GHTorrent compare to Boa?
Copyedits
"We do not show the same jealousy with the artifacts that comprise our research"
Jealousy is inappropriate here. I suggest:
"We are not so zealous with the artifacts..."
"of making our research even more widespread."
A more idiomatic way to phrase this is "of increasing the impact of our research."
"My PhD supervisor,"
Lose the comma:
"My PhD supervisor"
hacky Shell -> hacky shell
"The work is messy and often confuses the reader in terms of what have they done and how they have done."
This quote is agrammatical: the verb to do is transitive and therefore requires an object. Perhaps the actual quote ends with "and who they have done it."? If the actual quote is erroneous, Georgios should consider adding [sic] to signal that the error is in the original quote.
"The experiment seems foley, results somewhat lacking"
'Foley' is not an English word.
The titles are not in title case.
Gotta Mantra?
This chapter is already well-titled.
Best Points
What are the best points of the chapter that the authors should NOT change?
Georgios has built this chapter on two examples which he compares and contrasts. This is an effective rhetorical device that he should retain.

The chapter provides a good overview of the book and why compiling a book on data science in software context is important. If this chapter is to serve the overview of the entire book, I hope it includes a table of content.
Title of chapter
Learning Lessons over Lessons Learnt: Liftoff with Continuous Experimentation Towards Rapid Value Delivery
URL to the chapter
https://github.com/ds4se/chapters/blob/master/muench/Chapter_Muench.md
Message?
The problem of testing the value of features early on is well motivated by the chapter. The chapter is engaging to read and the message is very clear. I also liked seeing the key takeaways paragraph at the end to emphasize that continuous experimentation is necessary to understand that software is addressing a right problem.
A few sentences were rather confusing. Minor points below:
"Insights from experiments directly influence frequent deliveries." -- what is "frequent deliveries" here?
"usually good in" => "usually good at"
Accessible?
The chapter is very easy and engaging to read.
Size?
The size is appropriate.
Gotta Mantra?
I could not quite understand the term, "Liftoff with Continuous Experimentation" and "Rapid Value Delivery." Also these terms feel mouthful to read. How about "Continuous Experiment to Assess Values Early On"?
Best Points
The chapter is easy to read, and the message is clear. The chapter emphasizes the need of agile-like, continuous assessment based on the software engineering data. The goal is to understand software development is addressing the right problems that customers want the software to address early on and continuously.

Review for Mining Mobile App Stores
https://github.com/ds4se/chapters/issues/117
Unsolved
This was a fun chapter to read, but it suffers from three minor-to-moderate problems that, if addressed, would improve the chapter in my view.
MODERATE: The chapter is descriptive and clear in the treatment of the problem but does not contain actionable advice. What can I, either as a developer or user of mobile apps, do (better) as a result of the described mining exercise and subsequent analysis?
MODERATE: The chapter does not have a thesis statement up front nor a conclusion at the end. I found the last paragraph, which listed other things one could do with app repositories, distracting and out of place. I was expecting a punchline there. Along with the lack of actionable advice (issue #1), this made it look like more support for mining “because we can”.
MINOR: The following sentence struck me as a tautology: “For example, a 1 to 2 star ratio of 5 for a complaint type indicates that this complaint type has 5 times as many 1 star ratings as 2 star ratings.” I think it can easily be removed without loss of understandability or content. I think it would also be interesting to see, if you have the data, to what extent developers respond to the really negative comments in subsequent releases, and whether this, in turn, improves the given app’s reviews.

Energy mining presents a unique set of confounds that require careful consideration in SE research.

Overall the length is fine. I don't think adding the reference to the TI chip really adds much. The single example of the WattsUp Pro device is probably sufficient and is relatively jargon free.

Don't embarrass yourself: Beware of bias in your data
URL to the chapter
https://github.com/ds4se/chapters/blob/master/cabird/bias-chapter.md
Message?
There are actionable ways to avoid the use of biased data
written in one line or less
Accessible?
The first section is easy to understand and motivates the problem well. However, the whole example
(starting with "A few years ago") is difficult to understand and not well suited for illustration. I recommend to add more explanation, i.e., what is meant by the link between defect and commit. What is the value of this link? What is the value of the figure? I assume that all this covers the topic "When do changes induce fixes" but this is not explicitly mentioned in the text.
The guidelines are not suited for someone not familiar with statistics but I think that they have an appropriate level
and can motivate the reader to further explore the field.
Size?
Is the chapter the right length?
ok
Should anything missing be added?
I recommend to explain earlier the meaning of feature.
Can anything superfluous be removed (e.g. by deleting some section that does not work so well or by using less jargon, less formulae, lees diagrams, less references).?
I do not see the value of the figure. Maybe you add a concrete visualization to illustrate the first paragraph of the Section "Identifying bias".
What are the aspects of the chapter that authors SHOULD change?
The example (Bird 2009 study) needs better explanation or could be removed by another one.
Gotta Mantra?
We encouraged (but did not require) the chapter title to be a mantra or something cute/catchy, i.e., some slogan reflecting best practice for data science for SE? If you have suggestion for a better title, please put them here.

Make your research open from the beginning
Regarding title, I would change it to something that a broad audience understands. It is nice the suspense created by the title (one does not understand what should be open from the beginning) but I am afraid this game can play against raising the interest of reading the chapter. Let me suggest that the title includes the term Research since it is what the chapter discusses. Even the mantra you have to end the chapter would make a nice title. Or even in research openness done is better than perfect.

The length is fine. I have only few comments: (1) The alternative title does not seem completely aligned with the chapter content as the whole chapter deals with defects models and not in general with software analytics. I would drop it or maybe compound the two titles into something like “How the Release Process Impacts on Defect Prediction Modeling”; (2) The paragraph at the end of the first section sounds a bit academic. I would anticipate it soon after the student’s case and rephrase it a bit explaining what is in general the problem in analyzing defect data across releases. Perhaps just removing the sentence “The following sections discuss how steps (1) and (2) can go wrong when the release process of a project is not taken into account, and what could be done to resolve these problems.” and rephrasing the second sentence can be enough. (3) I would suggest saying explicitly “file-level defect prediction model” (i.e., removing the brackets around “file-level”) as there are other defect prediction models that do not use file characteristics. (e.g., Lyu’s models). In fact releases can impact on other types of defect models too. Maybe I it would be good to stress that the file-level defect models are one example which releases have impact on.

Title of chapter
Democratizing Data Analysis in Software Engineering
URL to the chapter
https://github.com/ds4se/chapters/blob/master/hongyu/DemocratizingData.md
Message?
The authors' visual analytics tool, MetroEyes, can help people who are not data scientists to analyze software engineering data.
Accessible?
Yes, except for the SQL query, but I think that's fine.
Size?
Is the chapter the right length? Yes
Should anything missing be added?
Perhaps an example of a success story with MetroEyes would make this chapter more salient.
Can anything superfluous be removed (e.g. by deleting some section that does not work so well or by using less jargon, less formulae, lees diagrams, less references).?
No
What are the aspects of the chapter that authors SHOULD change?
I feel that the sales of a software product, which is the example task shown in this chapter, is only tangentially considered "software engineering data". Perhaps a more appropriate example task could be visualizing the bugs, or time spent developing each software component, etc.
Gotta Mantra?
We encouraged (but did not require) the chapter title to be a mantra or something cute/catchy, i.e., some slogan reflecting best practice for data science for SE? If you have suggestion for a better title, please put them here.
Current title seems appropriate. Can't think of a mantra.
Best Points
What are the best points of the chapter that the authors should NOT change?
The explanation of the visual objects in terms of SQL queries immediately made me understand what MetroEyes does.

Player loses the listener's place in the episode

Player auto-playing and also dissapearing
https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/se-daily-iOS/issues/112
Unsolved
".The TestFlight feedback included screenshots.
In the Feed section I was playing an episode, then paused it and switched to another app. When I entered the app again, through TestFlight I believe, audio started playing on it’s own, despite there being no player controls or selected episode.
I waited to hear something that indicated which episode was playing. It turned out to be the 05/23/2018 episode “Uber’s Data Platform With Zhenxiao Luo.” When I clicked on it, the audio continued but still there were no player controls and the appearance of the Play button seemed to indicate that nothing was playing. Only when I hit Play did the controls become visible."

Any chance of getting this app on IOS 9
https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/se-daily-iOS/issues/55
Unsolved
I'd love to be able to use the app on my Iphone 4S. This would make it usable for a wider audience too,
as a lot of people don't necessarily want (or can) upgrade to the latest greatest (buggiest) phones.
Failing that, is there's dev documentation, maybe i can take it on. Thoughts?

svn compare revisions not working
https://github.com/RedpointGames/phabricator/issues/84
Unsolved
Hi,
we are hosting svn repositories on our phabricator server. So far these repositories work fine. We can commit, update etc... from windows and linux (ubuntu) hosts.
But from all clients we are unable to compare svn revisions, which make the repositories rather unusable. Thinks like "svn diff -r ... ..." don't work. Do you have any hints? The "docker logs phabricator" command dosen't show any related messages.
I start the container in a yaml file, like:
phabricator:
image: redpointgames/phabricator
container_name: phabricator
ports:
- "22:22"
networks:
- proxy-tier
links:
- mysql_phabricator:mysql
volumes:
- /data/phabricator/repos:/var/repo
- /data/phabricator/ssh_keys:/hostkeys
- /data/phabricator/certificates:/config
- ./proxy/certs:/ssl
- ./scripts:/scripts
environment:
- ENABLE_APCU=true
- SCRIPT_BEFORE_MIGRATION=/scripts/preamble.sh
- VIRTUAL_NETWORK=nginx-proxy
- MYSQL_HOST=mysql
- MYSQL_PORT=3306
- MYSQL_USER=***
- MYSQL_PASS=***
- PHABRICATOR_HOST=***
- PHABRICATOR_CDN=***
- PHABRICATOR_REPOSITORY_PATH=/var/repo
- PHABRICATOR_HOST_KEYS_PATH=/hostkeys/persisted

Contradiction concerning PATCH HTTP status code
https://github.com/deliveroo/deliveroo.engineering/issues/135
Unsolved
It seems there's a contradiction in the guidelines concerning HTTP status codes return by PATCH:
In PATCH, mutating entities
200 OK, if the modification succeeded
In Return codes and errors
POST and PATCH should never result in a 200 (generally 201, occasionally 202).

Gently "enforce" whitespace removal and common code formatting rules in guidelines source
https://github.com/deliveroo/deliveroo.engineering/issues/122
Unsolved
Why?
To minimize annoying diffs and potential conflicts due to whitespace and code formatting in general.
A recent example of the problem is #121 in which I've made a simple change (literally added a -).
Because of my editor setup to remove whitespace at the end of the line, there where changes in irrelevant lines.
Possible solution
We could use something like http://editorconfig.org/ to (try to) "enforce" it in non-critical repositories/projects such as this one.
Like, including a .editorconfig in the project root.
This way we will be lowering the barrier because most of the editors/IDEs has support for that.
The side effects will be minimal for everyone NOT using .editorconfig. It does not break anything.
Also if anyone wants to (s)he can download a plugin from http://editorconfig.org/#download
Help wanted
What do you guys think? Should we go for it?

Create a proper Engineering Team members page
https://github.com/deliveroo/deliveroo.engineering/issues/74
Unsolved
As per the conversation here, it would help with the visibility of the team and their various contributions to deliveroo.engineering if we had a full engineering team members page, with bios and nice staff photos for all members of the team, not just those who’ve posted blogs.
This is preferable because:
Not everyone who contributes to deliveroo.engineering does so via a blog post (they can contribute guidelines, review feedback or, y’know, might have built the site itself 😛)
It can help illustrate the diversity of our team
We’re all just so pretty, and the world needs to know.
The existing layout of the authors page is probably mostly fine (I’d envisage the circular portraits increasing in size) but we’d need proper photography (i.e. taken in good light, with a proper camera, in a proper setting) for all team members.

Expand on API guidelines: versioning
https://github.com/deliveroo/deliveroo.engineering/issues/30
Unsolved
@tompave-roo suggested in #23 that we expand on API guidelines:
Can we be a bit more specific about what we intend with "API versioning"?
And, should API versions be endpoint specific?
Common questions I've heard asked in the past:
are API versions relative to specific paths, or to the entire API surface?
in other words can a v=2 be released only for some paths?
if a new version must be rolled out for the same API, is it ok to have /dogs v2 and /dogs v1 return different responses, but /cats v2 be a simple alias for /cats v1?
what about cases where the resource sets of different versions are different? For example, /koalas might be introduced with v=3.
Some of these might be misconceptions of how API versioning works, but then it would be a good idea to state clearly how this should work.

Docker overview - add app packaging & OS config automation analogies
https://github.com/uribench/software-engineering-handbook/issues/9
Unsolved
Docker overviews sometimes focus on the top-down description with analogies to Docker being a lightweight VM or similar. A bottom-up context is, instead, an analogy with application dependency packaging & installers. For example, walking through: create a component->add dependent components to create a package->add external library dependencies->add OS config dependencies, e.g., FS directories, other apps->package all of these into an installer (sometimes with OS config automation, e.g., puppet/chef/ansible/salt). You can then think of a container as an alternative to an installer/OS config automation. It packages all dependencies together including some OS config dependencies -- the container is like a post-install/post-config packaging of the application.

Consider adding CI tests
https://github.com/uribench/software-engineering-handbook/issues/8
Unsolved
It would probably be beneficial if the repo runs automated build tests on each PR and each push.
Things that can be tested:
Markdown style - can be done with markdownlint (ruby) or pymarkdownliny (python)
Broken links - can be done with markdown-helpers (ruby)
Config folder validation (custom solution)
There are two implementation routes as I see them:
Implement all the code needed for testing in this repo directly. This is easier, but probably less desirable, if we want to keep the repo's "documentation only" nature.
Implement all the code needed as part of the software-engineering-handbook-tools repo - but then, it must first be converted to an installable pip package, so it is accessible to Travis.

Call 'handbook build' command automatically to always keep the Handbook folder on the GitHub repository current with the contents (guides and topics) and config files.

This could either be done by the builder itself, or, if we opt to use a completely custom theme, it might be possible to implement it in the theme layout itself (see #3).

Object snapshots
https://github.com/ermau/Instant/issues/21
Unsolved
Currently, object values are simply strings generated by [DebuggerDisplay] and/or .ToString(); We need to be able to take a snapshot of the object's state if we ever want to be able to move closer to debugger-like functionality.
We could:
Create a deep copy of the object (hard, slow, complete)
Track external property changes differently, associating it with the object (easy, faster, far from complete)
This would probably be an optional feature, given potential performance implications.

Mobile Element finding crashes when contigs are identified across two IS elements
https://github.com/churchlab/millstone/issues/675
Unsolved
Mobile element calling code contains an assertion that both sets of vertices come from the same mobile element. We have found cases where this fails:
# in genome_finish/graph_contig_placement.py
>translocation_seq_verts
[ME_insertion_sequence:IS150_RC_121, ME_insertion_sequence:IS186_RC_253]
This could be because the mobile elements look similar at the alignment region.
There are two ways to fix this:
ignore these mobile elements (not ideal)
combine them with (IS150/IS186)
I think this is just a really confusing highly paralogous region. I blasted the contig and just got more confused. However, there is definitely an IS element involved here:

Wow, a large fraction of students bombed the reading quiz for 5.2 (Comprehension). They did not get the meaning of consistency or static typing. They were thrown off by the sentence that said that React JS used a declarative programming paradigm, making it easier to debug, and inferred that it must mean that JS also uses a declarative paradigm. Oops. I think this may correlate with general programming experiences among the students in the class.

Add accessibility module
https://github.com/andyjko/cooperative-software-development/issues/34
Unsolved
Anushka's feedback:
Hi! I think it went really well. We covered a lot of ground with an overview of accessibility development and then a deep dive into autism. I included two brainstorming breakouts with their teams. They identified some problem areas with their current apps (e.g., lack of keyboard support, inaccessible graphics). I talked about the semantic web & that seemed like new info to everyone. We had a good discussion about the nuances of designing for a user group like autism. A student even brought up the juicy question of whether we should design an app that's accessible for everyone or tailor experiences based on user profiles. I think there's value in having this type of accessibility-focused module in the course going forward. Or incorporating accessibility principles in the other modules. What are your thoughts on that?

From Shriram Krishnamurthi:
Fortran wasn't invented in 2002, Lisp in 1978, etc. In fact, the Fortran, C++ and Smalltalk references would suggest that all three languages are younger than the three languages at the end of the sentence: Java, Python, and JavaScript! I think you should model better scholarship for your students. In particular, citing a person who did not create Fortran for Fortran is … wrong (at least the other three credit their creators).

Software quality: confusion about specific qualities

From Andy Begel: > Today’s reading discussion revealed that the reading about Software Quality has some issues. @andy Ko students did not understand interoperability (one thought it was about user interfaces, not APIs), and had trouble distinguishing robustness from reliability. I think we need to separate out privacy from security as well. Finally, I would divide up the big list of 14 qualities into three sections: factors related to the program, factors related to the user of the application, and factors related to the software developers who write the program.

Conways law is confusing

From Andy Begel:
The Communication reading does a poor job of explaining Conway’s Law. Most students who answered the “What is Conway’s Law” reading quiz seem to think it says that the application reflects the values of the teams of people who built it; that is, if people can work together well, then the product will turn out ok. Maybe that’s a corollary, but it misses the simpler point of the communication structures mirroring the organizational hierarchy.

In several pages and posts there are absolute links to https://rse.shef.ac.uk.
These do not work in local builds, and if we were to change the root of the site all these URLS would need updating. Nikola provides a mechanism to link directly to individual posts or tags (see https://getnikola.com/path-handlers.html) although the root path handler does not behave as expected, so I'm unsure of the most nikola-correct way of linking to a page such as https://rse.shef.ac.uk/contact/alumni.

Replace the regex expression to remove all string/character and comments of failing test methods
https://github.com/rjust/defects4j/issues/185
Unsolved
The framework/util/rm_broken_tests.pl script parses the output of a test suite compilation/execution and fixes failing test methods by replacing each broken test method with a dummy test method in the source file of the corresponding test class. For instance, supposing the following test suite with a failing test method (test1):
public class TestFoo {
  @Test
  public void test0() {
    assertTrue(true);
  }

  @Test
  public void test1() {
    String str = new String();
    str = 123456789;
  }
}
is then transformed to:
public class TestFoo {
  @Test
  public void test0() {
    assertTrue(true);
  }

  @Test
  public void test1() {}
// Defects4J: flaky method
//   @Test
//   public void test1() {
//     String str = new String();
//     str = 123456789;
//   }
}
Basically, the script parses the compilation/execution output and identifies the line where the failing test method starts/ends and it uses a regex expression to remove all string/character and comments of the failing test method as they may contain unbalanced delimiters or brackets (which may cause problems to find the last } of the test method). Although the script has been working fine in general, two issues (#96 and #184) have been reported related to that regex expression. Perhaps a more robust solution would be to build a parser that computes a line-number table for all methods and then use that table to comment out failing test methods.

How to collect bugs with Defects4J approach?
https://github.com/rjust/defects4j/issues/180
Unsolved
Hi,
I'm interested in collecting bugs with the approach used to collect bugs for Defects4J described in [1]. More specifically, I would like to know the following:
Is there a public available tool (containing the "automated steps" described in the paper) that I can use?
If yes, how can I use it, and what is the criteria that projects must meet to be used for collecting bugs?
Thanks in advance.

regarding bug traces
https://github.com/rjust/defects4j/issues/175
Unsolved
Firstly I thanks @rjust for providing such a comprehensive data set. it would really help the learners. i am exploring the data set and have following query.
I am trying to link the bugs with corresponding test cases and the class where bug is reported. I found
a folder modified_classes under following directory structure.
\framework\projects\Lang\modified_classes
there are files like 1,2,3.... the contents of file 1 are as following
org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils
Does it mean that bug was present in class NumberUtils?
and the triggering test case 1 under framework\projects\Lang\trigger_tests reveals that bug?
Thanks in anticipation

TravisCI builds fail nondeterministically
https://github.com/rjust/defects4j/issues/172
Unsolved
Currently, there are four factors in the TravisCI process that can cause a nondeterministic failure, rather than a failure that comes as the result of any changes made to the Defects4J framework. Three of these are clearly related to timing issues that seem to occur on TravisCI - likely as a result of how TravisCI allocated virtual machines.
Potentially helpful information here: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/overview/
Issue 1:
Jobs time out after 50 minutes. This can happen to any task, even if it completed successfully in a previous build - the time needed to complete a task is not consistent. The best solution may be to split some tasks into a larger number. However, at times, any task in the list can time out.
Issue 2:
TravisCI job 2 (carton exec ./test_mutation_analysis.sh) sometimes fails nondeterministically. 36 mutants are supposed to be killed by the test, but at times, an additional 37th mutant is killed.
$ carton exec ./test_mutation_analysis.sh

Issue 3:
Task 43 (carton exec ./test_verify_bugs.sh -p Math -b1..18) fails nondeterministically.
One of the relevant tests for Math 15 (org.apache.commons.math3.genetics.FixedElapsedTimeTest::testIsSatisfied) is based on timing constraints and fails on TravisCI nondeterministically. I cannot replicate this issue locally, so I suspect it is related to TravisCI VM allocation.
Issue 4:
Tasks 48-50:
carton exec ./test_verify_bugs.sh -p Mockito -b1..5
carton exec ./test_verify_bugs.sh -p Mockito -b6..10
script: carton exec ./test_verify_bugs.sh -p Mockito -b11..15
One of the relevant tests for Mockito versions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11 (org.mockitousage.verification.VerificationAfterDelayTest::shouldVerifyNormallyWithSpecificTimes) is based on timing constraints and fails on TravisCI nondeterministically. I cannot replicate this issue locally, so I suspect it is related to TravisCI VM allocation.
Note that in both this case and the Math case, the flaky tests could be removed without issue. They are not trigger tests. They are on the relevant test list because they load affected classes, but are not used to verify behavior relevant to the noted issues.

Changes in Spectra and Matrix Throughout Versions
https://github.com/rjust/defects4j/issues/165
Unsolved
Hello All,
I have been reading and trying to find answers to this but excuse me if this issue was already brought to your attention. I am working with all the programs and the comparison of some fault localization metrics.
I was looking at the Gzoltar results from (https://bitbucket.org/rjust/fault-localization-data/) and I run the script myself too but for some versions of the same subject program there are dramatic changes in spectra and matrix outputs, for example ; Chart-10 has 1 test in its matrix with some 50 spectra elements and Chart-4 has some 18.000 spectra elements. I first thought this might be a side effect of mocking or something but I don't see any use of that either.
If you could enlighten me on how these results are possible, it would be a great help ! Please let me know if I can provide you more explanation or examples. Thank you for your answers in advance.

Compiling Tests for Tracing with Daikon
https://github.com/rjust/defects4j/issues/162
Unsolved
Hello,
I am attempting to evaluate the difference between the bug and fixed version of some of the Math projects by looking at possible invariants generated by Daikon.
As far as I know, I need to be able to provide Daikon a jar file to trace or an appropriate class with an entry point (such as void main). I have been attempting the first route with no success. Is it possible to create a jar that runs through a single test or all of the tests in sequence?
As an example, I would like to create a trace of Math 50 Bug org.apache.commons.math.analysis.solvers.RegulaFalsiSolverTest::testIssue631 by compiling a jar that exercises this testIssue631 or be able to generate a .class that acts as an excising wrapper for that previously mentioned class::method.
I am a novice when it comes to Java and its command line tool chain, so any information or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

defects4j test on Time_4 reports 144 failed test cases under java 1.8
https://github.com/rjust/defects4j/issues/149
Unsolved
Sorry for disturbing you with this question. I am currently trying to use Astor, the repair tool requiring Java 1.8 for compilation and running, to repair Time_4 from Defects4j, which requires JDK 1.7.
Therefore, as indicated in the Defects4j readme.md, Time_4 exposes 144 failures ( only one failure is expected) during the tests execution. When I change the Java version into 1.7, the extra failures disappear, but Astor cannot run...
So I want to ask that is there any java-8 support for Defects4j which can make Time bugs compile and test as expected? Thank you!

This is on Randoop 3.1.5.
It appears that both classes in Apache Lang are indeed package private. (ie declared as just class Name not public class Name) but the Defects4J paper (Do Automatically Generated Unit tests...) shows randoop as running tests on those classes. Do you have any idea if there has been a change in behavior in Randoop since then or was some other setting used for generating those tests?

Mockito builds can be extremely slow, compared to the other projects -- in particular if gradle needs to be downloaded. Additionally, the defined dependencies lead to running the entire test suite whenever a compilation is performed -- the tests should be skipped unless explicitly executed.

Software Testing - Role, Principles, and Limitations
1.Introduction
The following definition of software testing is cited from a conference material written by Cem Kaner, 2006, and is quoted by Wikipedia as a widely-accepted definition:
"Software testing is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or service under test." [1]
The statement classifies testing as an investigation that shows stakeholders
how good the quality of the software under development is. It gives the idea that testing is important to the product software. It does not contain information about how the investigation should be performed and to what extent developers can rely on testing.
As an expansion to the above, this report first analyses the role of testing in software development process, then introduces some rules of thumbs to apply general testing techniques, and finally discusses what testing is not and what cannot be achieved through testing.
2.The Role of Testing in Software Development
The importance of testing in a software development process is necessary to be understood by every software engineer, but is also trivial. Testing does not only reduce number of bugs in codes, it also examines if the implemented functionalities meet the corresponding requirements.
2.1 Testing in Waterfall Model
In a traditional waterfall model, testing is the one last step before the product system is delivered to customer. All assessments about meeting the requirements are carried out at this stage. However, with very limited time allowed for the entire project, it is very often that the time remaining for testing is squeezed heavily.
Moreover, In a fast changing environment, it is quite possible that by the time the system is completed, the original requirements may have already become old fashioned. In addition, in the case of a small project, more time could be spent on planning and documentation than on designing, implementing and testing.
Thus, comprehensive testing is rarely finished. The step which is equivalent to quality checking for the product system cannot receive enough time to proceed. [2]
2.2 Testing in Incremental Model
In contrast with waterfall model, the incremental model has emerged in this rapidly changing environment. Methods of this model like Agile or XP usually use a test-driven development approach. In this approach, the whole project is broken down into several increments or iterations to be completed in shorter time boxes. In each iteration, tests are written before the actual implementation. An implementation is correct only if it can pass the existing test cases designed for it.
As a result, testing is interleaved with analysis, design, and implementation. So developers can spend more effective time on testing to have it carefully planned and carried out.
3.Principles of Testing
After having a good understanding of the importance of testing, this section discusses how general testing methods and techniques, i.e. static and dynamic methods, box testing, unit testing, integration testing, acceptance testing, etc., are applied in normal software development projects.
3.1 Test a program to try to make it fail
Dijkstra said that "testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs [3]". The interpretation of this is obvious: except for trivial systems, those many test cases a developer can come up with are just a part of all possible scenarios. So testing is to execute the program with the intention to find bugs [4], not with the intention to show it is bug free. A good testing practice should show the program fails at some point, and after debugging, it can show the program successes at the same point.
3.2 Test early and regularly
Not surprising at all, fixing bugs is more expensive if it spotted at a later stage, but it is surprising how tremendously more expensive it is. Figure 1 shows that, in a waterfall model, cost of finding and fixing bugs is the result of an exponential function of time. It is also the case in test-driven approach, where a bug in an early iteration can accumulate to become a bigger problem and propagate to other components.
Figure 1. Cost of Fixing Bugs in Warterfall Model [5]
Additionally, tests should be carried out on a regular basis since when new components are added in, they may have unexpected effects on existing ones. Also, as long as the requirements are changed, test cases should be updated accordingly.
3.3 Testing is context dependant
The test methods to be used should depend on the context of the system to satisfy various requirements [6]. Test cases should be composed according to different components. Even with the same component in the same system, testing objectives can be different at different point of time. For example, unit testing checks if each component functions properly as individuals, while integration testing focuses on interaction between several components as a whole.
3.4 Define a Test Plan
A test plan should address test scope, test strategy, test methods and techniques, test results interpretation, and how comprehensive the test cases are to cover the possible scenarios. Also importantly, it should include how the tests are going to reveal the customer requirements, and how requirements are measured [7][8][9]. Furthermore, a risk assessment of the system under development should be considered here. The essence of risk assessment can be illustrated from the negative results of software disasters such as the Denver Airport Baggage Handling System [10] and the Fukoshima Nuclear Disaster [11]. Missing or under evaluating a risk may result in too few or even no specific tests covering this risk at all, which will further result in hidden faults, which finally leads to system failure.
3.5 Test for valid as well as invalid inputs
Test cases should of course include valid inputs, thus to mimic regular scenarios, which are the most likely real life situations. After those, developers should think about if things can go wrong with invalid inputs such as null pointers, out-of-bound index, etc. The reason is not only because statistically there are always a chance for exceptions to occur, but it is also quite often that a system is crashed by a single component which has got an unexpected input. Moreover, an interesting thing is, during testing, invalid input conditions seem to have higher error detection yield than test cases with valid input conditions [4].
4.Limitations of Testing
4.1 Testing cannot show bug-free
Also according to that famous quote of Dijkstra: "Testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs [3]." In reality, testing is based on comparing actual outputs to expected outputs of a component in response to some inputs. These inputs are just a subset of all possible scenarios. Since very likely there are a great many of possibilities, it is rarely practical for one to be able to carry out exhaust testing. Hence, a good test case may indicate the existence of a fault within some component, or after the fault is corrected, it may show that component does not produce a particular kind of error when it receives a particular kind of input, but it never gives the idea that this component does not produce any kind of bug in response to any kind of input.
4.2 Tests are no substitute for specifications
With test-driven methods, developers write codes to pass the tests. Conventionally, the code becomes deliverable once it passes all tests. So to some extent, testing has substituted the requirement specification. However, tests, no matter how many test cases they include, are just instances of the requirements, which provide an abstraction of the expected outcome [12]. It is true that requirement specification is used for generating test cases, but inversely, using test cases to summarise a requirement is a conduct should be avoided. It is like a universal statement can be used to prove as many existential statements with the same predicate as desired, but no matter how many existential statements conjunction together, they cannot be used to prove a single universal statement with the same predicate.
4.3 Software testing does not help in finding root causes
IEEE standard terminology states:
"An unsatisfactory program execution is a 'failure', pointing to a 'fault' in the program, itself is the result of a 'mistake' in the programmer’s thinking."
According to section 3.1, testing is to execute the program to make it fail. It is the process to uncover failures in the program. So testing tells the developers the test subject does not generate satisfactory output in response to some certain inputs. However, it does not tell how the inputs are processed to result in such outputs. In other words, testing does not help in finding root causes, i.e. where, when, and how things go wrong, which lead the software to malfunction in the first place. That is done via another distinct activity known as debugging.
4.4 Extra Coding and Extra Chance to Have Bugs
No matter how automated the testing procedure a project is using, it requires some minimal level of human coding in the first place. Obviously, coding for testing means extra work to do. From instantiating components and initialising test inputs, to inter-component communication and results interpretation， every piece of work is an additional programming task. Moreover, additional programming means additional chance to have bugs. For a failed test case, a developer has to check both the source code and test code for faults, because it may turn out to be that the logic or result interpretation is wrong within the test code.
5.Recommendation
Let us examine the definition in section 1 given by Kaner again. It is true that passing tests can at least show the software does not produce faulty outputs in situations covered by existing test cases. Plus, if these test cases are carefully planned, then it is reasonable for the stakeholders to be confident in the software's correctness. So the connection between testing and quality does exist and is important to keep in mind.
However, passing tests is equivalent to quality assurance for the product system is usually not the case. Test cases are instances of real life situations. They are elements of a subset of all possible inputs. What testing can prove is merely the performance based on that subset. Using the property of a subset to draw a conclusion for the full set is absolutely invalid.

Introduction
This practical will supply a comprehensive test plan for the game 2048. The main objective of test plan is examine the program behavior and accuracy. The functioning of the game is to tilt the gaming board (4X4 grid) to move the tiles containing values floating on the board in the left, right, top and bottom direction. The objective of the game is to merge the two tiles containing the same values and the resulting tile will represent the summation of two equal values. After merging two tiles a tilt of the gaming board in any direction will generate a new tile with the multiple value of 2, 4, 16 e.g. The ultimate goal of the game is to achieve a tile containing the value 2048. The score will be increased with the value equal to the value produced with the merging of two identical tiles. At the beginning of the game two tiles containing either 2 or 4 will be appeared in two random locations of the gaming board. The score will be initialized as zero at the beginning of the game. The game will be considered to be over while there is no empty cell left to move any of the tiles on the board and while the player achieved the tile containing value 2048.
Software Specifications
i. NetBeans IDE version 8
ii. Github account algh0065
iii. Internet connection
Test Scenarios
Game Board Representation
At the initial stage of the game a test is performed to check the representation of the board. The test is performed for game board representation as follows:
i. A 4X4 grid will represent the entire board of the game, where two tiles will be highlighted at random locations of the board in the beginning.
ii. The highlighted two tiles will contain 2 values individually.
Substantiation of User Input
In order to verify the user input the following test steps are performed.
i. The input is considered to be valid if the user chooses any of the keyboard buttons namely 1, 2, 3, 4, or x.
ii. The input is considered to be invalid if the use chooses any other buttons other than 1, 2, 3, 4 or x.
iii. An invalid input resulting in error message pop-up saying that invalid input.
Conducting User Input
This will test the movements of the board while pressing particular input button.
i. The game board must be tilted up for the input of ‘1’ button of the keyboard.
ii. The game board must be tilted down for the input of ‘2’ button of the keyboard.
iii. The game board must be tilted right for the input of ‘3’ button of the keyboard.
iv. The game board must be tilted left for the input of ‘4’ button of the keyboard.
Tilting in the Up Direction
This will test the conditions for which the tiles will move up.
i. Tiles must move to the up when there are empty cells in the above of the columns of current tiles position.
ii. One Tile must move to the up and merge a tile of the same value in the above of the current tile value.
iii. A Tile must not move to the up when there is no empty cell in the above of the column of the current tile position.
iv. Tiles must not move to the up when they reached the top most position (i.e., top edge) of the board.
Tilting in the Down Direction
This will test the conditions for which the tiles will move down.
i. Tiles must move to the down when there are empty cells in the below of the columns of current tiles position.
ii. One Tile must move to the down and merge a tile of the same value in the below of the current tile value.
iii. A Tile must not move to the down when there is no empty cell in the below of the column of the current tile position.
iv. Tiles must not move to the down when they reached the bottom most position (i.e., bottom edge) of the board.
Tilting in the Right Direction
This will test the conditions for which the tiles will move right.
i. Tiles must move to the right when there are empty cells in the right of the rows of current tiles position.
ii. One Tile must move to the right and merge a tile of the same value in the right of the current tile value.
iii. A Tile must not move to the right when there is no empty cell in the right of the row of the current tile position.
iv. Tiles must not move to the right when they reached the right most position (i.e., right edge) of the board.
Tilting in the Left Direction
This will test the conditions for which the tiles will move left.
i. Tiles must move to the left when there are empty cells in the left of the rows of current tiles position.
ii. One Tile must move to the left and merge a tile of the same value in the left of the current tile value.
iii. A Tile must not move to the left when there is no empty cell in the left of the row of the current tile position.
iv. Tiles must not move to the left when they reached the left most position (i.e., left edge) of the board.
Condition for Merging Two Tiles
This will illustrate the condition for which two tiles will be merged into one.
i. Merging is possible to get one tile with the addition of the values containing two tiles only when the two tiles containing the same value and positioned adjacent to each other.
Score Calculation
The score of the game will be calculated in the following ways:
ii. At the very beginning of the game the score will be initialized as zero.
iii. The score will be increased with the value equal to the value obtained through merging of two tiles of equal values.
Game Expiration (Game Over)
The game will be expired in the following conditions:
i. The user may terminate the game anytime during the game by pressing the ‘x’ button.
ii. The game will be terminated when the user achieved the desired value 2048 in one tile and a message will pop-up representing game over.
iii. The game will be terminated when there is no empty cell left to move any of the tiles in any direction and a message will pop-up representing game over.
Game Limitations
The limitations of the game is pointed in the following
i. There is no option for this game kept for multi-user at a time.
ii. There are no multiple levels maintained for this game.
iii. Since it is a single player game the networking option is invalid.
Dependencies and Risks
There are some dependencies and risks reflected with this game. It is recommended that the user should learn the functioning and the rules of the game in order to be able to avoid risks for playing the game.

Monte Carlo
https://github.com/Derek-Jones/ESEUR-book/issues/2
Unsolved
Hello Derek,
I've read the chapter on Economics and noticed you're planning to add something on Monte Carlo. Recently I gave a short lecture on financial modelling to Engineering students. Here are the slides:
https://minorsmart.github.io/presentaties/hhs
The interesting bit for you would be the second part. I have included notebooks with code examples.
I would also suggest to include the notion of real options in this chapter which could be modelled using MC Simulation.
Kind regards,
Witek ten Hove

.gitignore pattern ambigous
https://github.com/Stvad/Software_Engineering__git/issues/1
Unsolved
The question
What .gitignore pattern would you use to ignore all .txt files in the doc folder?
is ambigous with it asking for
doc/**/*.txt
because
doc/*.txt
is the right one according to the minimum information principle. The correct question would be
What .gitignore pattern would you use to ignore all .txt files under the doc folder?
, as the in is the most fitting word to describe files only directly in the doc folder, but not any subfolders. I know this is just a slight difference and subject to personal preferences, but we should be able to declare it too ambiguous and therefore subject to result in different thoughtpaths on each revising and we know this results in poor learning efficiency.

如果有任何内容，可以email补充。
我从github数据上看到，有四位同学Ragnarosaa，taoxinyi，while9608和Xynnn007上传了代码。其他同学是线下工作的么？
如果这样，还请这些同学在个人总结中讲清楚个人工作内容。
请注意：github的数据仅作为参考，考虑到同学们基础差异较大，具体个人的评分还要看个人总结的情况。

Referencing to papers and/or software via stable links where possible
https://github.com/slebok/slebok/issues/23
Unsolved
I propose to reference any external artifact through generic, well-accepted links, with some confidence of stability. This includes DOIs (dx.doi...), links to institutional repositories (INRIA Hal, CWI repo, etc.), Wikipedia or Archive (if we must).
This would, however, exclude: homepages, blogs, and bibsleigh or related projects (in order to minimize dependencies on "third"-party projects ;-).

Attribute grammar terms
https://github.com/slebok/slebok/issues/20
Unsolved
Overall plan:
Add AG terms into the glossary of terms (mostly Görel)
Synchronize with the AG reader (Tony, Eric, ...)
Internal review by AG people (Tony, Eric, PhD students in our groups, ...)
Review by non-AG people (Benoit, Tanya, ...)
Guidelines:
Most of the terms have the word attribute in the filename.
All the terms should be reachable from the main entry: attribute_grammar.md
Terms left to write about:
concurrent attribute evaluation
object-oriented attribute grammars
attribute evaluation during parsing (like in ANTLR)
context conditions
abstract grammar
extending AGs with relations

Would it be relevant to include a list of SLE tools (parser generators, language workbenches, metaprogramming environments, etc.)? As a top-level directory 'tools'?
These tools could cross-reference from/to the terms and other parts of the SLEBoK. This would help to answer questions such as: "I need to write refactoring transformations for my language. What tool should I use considering that I'm working in the EMF ecosystem?".

SLE reader
https://github.com/slebok/slebok/issues/12
Unsolved
I really like the idea expressed by @inkytonik during the round of introductions, about creating the SLE reader by boldly going everywhere, including where no man has gone before. In other words, to have a reasonably comprehensive list/tree of overview papers, each of which classified into one of the three categories:
nice/ready/complete - where we are completely happy with the overview and can use it in SLE courses as is
imperfect/biased - where a good overview exists (such as Grune-Jacobs' Parsing Techniques or Sebesta's Concepts), but it id not SLE-able enough to be immediatelt useful in our context
nonexistant/could-be/would-be - where an overview is totally possible and conceivable, but not written yet. Hopefully having a well-defined request like this will inspire people (especially young researchers who have a lot of time on their hands and want to get famous) to write those.

BNF:
https://github.com/slebok/slebok/issues/10
Unsolved
the item on BNF needs careful consideration; i.e. based on @grammarware investigation on the many dialects of BNF; its syntax and semantics. and this is related to the many parser generators and their semantics.
For starters, on https://github.com/slebok/slebok/blob/master/terms/Backus-Naur_form.md, I think we should make clear in the definition that the term BNF refers to a family of similar notations for the definition of context-free grammars.

구글 블로그로 요즘 떠오르는 IT관련 키워드나, 내용들을 실으려 합니다.
개념 하나하나, 용어 하나하나 정리하면서 전혀 배경지식이 없어도
읽을 수 있는 내용으로 게시글을 올리려 합니다.
예를 들어 '빅 데이터'라는 주제가 있으면
빅데이터가 뭔지, 왜 갑자기 뜨게 되었는지와 같은 내용들을 토막글로 실는 것입니다.

Unsolved
One of our user cases is to create a toolbar for the project that allows the user to jump between all of our cases without having to click back and go to the main screen. Well we found out it can't be done since we need the whole project to be in border pane, something about menu bar in sceenbuilder not liking anchor pane. which explains why it worked on our team's project but it did not work when we integrated. kyle has talked to the UI team about it.

Alcune modifiche da apportare al sito
https://github.com/InformaticaSaraLei/ProgettoSito/issues/101
Unsolved
Ciao ragazzi. Ieri mi ha scritto Cortesì dicendomi che finalmente ha ricevuto le osservazioni dalla commissione di pari opportunità e chiedendomi di informare i gruppi che devono apportare alcune modifiche.
La mail che ho ricevuto da Cortesi:
Karina,
ti inoltro le osservazioni che (dopo lunghissima attesa!) ci sono
finalemnte arrivate dalla commissione pari opportunita'. Puoi per
favore chiedere al gruppo che si e' occupato della grafica di
apportare le modifiche richieste, e al gruppo di integrazione di
aggiornare il tutto?
Grazie
a.cortesi
La mail che ha ricevuto Cortesi con la richiesta delle modifiche:
Gentile Agostino
ti invio in allegato una nota che riepiloga quanto ci siamo detti nel
corso della riunione dell'11 marzo 2015.
Nella nota troverai anche alcuni appunti che riguardano la modifica
dell'immagine in home page.
Per comodità ti allego anche delle prove con due tipi di colore.
Valutate anche voi quale vi sembra meglio considerato che vanno
inseriti i loghi.
Per qualsiasi necessità di chiarimento sono a disposizione.
Un saluto e grazie
Cristina Greggio



La seconda mail che ho ricevuto da Cortesi:
Oltre a quanto detto nella lettera della Greggio, biognerebbe che le
icone che danno accesso alle videointerviste avessero come etichetta
associata in sovraimpressione la figura professionale
corrispondente... ma su questo ci possiamo lavorare non appena abbiamo
le videointerviste in formato definitivo.
Fatemi sapere se ci sono domande o problemi.

Added BDD feature management / Basic PDF export
https://github.com/tmerten/redmine_re/pull/3
Unsolved
Hi There,
First thanks for your great work. It helped me to increase the productivity of my customer and to tighten the requirements definition process and management as well. Basically what the KOREM plugin was intended for.
As I suggested my customer to select a Behavior Driven Development (BDD) approach for their projects to collect requirements I added the possibility to KOREM to add so called features from the BDD philosophy to the Redmine database. For further information on this please read on here.
One missing feature also was that it is not simply possible to export the requirements and other added data from the plugin. We could have done this via an external interface (e.g. database admin interface), but a direct export was mandatory.
So I spend the effort and also added the possibility to export the tree structure as flat PDF file by right clicking on the tree root node and select the "Export" option. This feature uses pdfkit which requires wkhtmltopdf - I updated the gem file accordingly and added some information to the README.rdoc file.
I would be happy if you merge the changes in your main stream and if we could get together to talk about further adjustments which I have in mind, not only related to the export function, but also to other missing features.
Cheers,
Marvin Kruse

When we load the application, the optional input should not be shown below.

Design Decisions/Thinking
Not used mock because it's simple
time vs string for created field - There's no date manipulation, so I'll use String
Intentionally less comments - Try to write self-explained code
Split Todo/Task of Dao, Service, Resource? I choose not to split because Task actions are always with todoId.
When empty result - 200 vs 204? I think it's better to reply 204 than return empty result such as [], but it's okay to return 200.
Very basic storage model - store whole data in one file
Simple cmdline args processing
Guice + Jersey2 is not that fun to work with together...:(
What I didn't do because of it's not necessary or there's not enough time
Concurrency - I only apply locking for saving to file of the data. There're many issues such as Lost Updates, Inconsistent Retrievals, etc. To prevent them, transactional processing mechanism is required.
A thorough param check, logging, exception handling.
Usually, I prefer to write each layers of Resource, Service, DAO, etc independently with mocking, but pass this time.
Real DB with JPA - I think the requirements showed that real DB/JPA is not necessary.

Build and Run

TestCase
mvn test
3 test case exist.
TodoRestApiTest : call REST api by http request. It use mock Repo instead of real Repo.
IntegrationTest : test with real Repo.
MapDbTodoRepoTest : test working with MapDb.
Architecture
Resource --> Service --> Repo
TodoRestApi : Jersey resource file. endpoint is defined. call TodoService
TodoService : treat business logic. use TodoRepo for storing
TodoRepo : repository interface
-- AbstractMapBaseTodoRepo : abstract repo class which use map
-- MapDbTodoRepo : concret repo class which extends AbstractMapBaseTodoRepo.
TodoServer : Server Main. provide getInstance() which create instance by Guice
Repository
Use MapDb(http://www.mapdb.org/) for storing which use local file for persistence.
Limitation
Didn't consider expandability. It means only valid for single server beacuse of repository
Didn't consider performance
Didn't treat detail exception case. Not defined in requirement as like duplicated name.
Change Endpoint
GET /todos/:todo_id for get task list is not correct.
I implemented with GET /todos/:todl_id/tasks instead.

Design issue in association class section
https://github.com/se-edu/se-book/issues/45
Unsolved
Hi there! I was looking through your online book, and I wanted to point out that there's a design issue in the section on inheritance. From the text:
However, the two classes cannot be simply replaced with a more general class Person because of the need to distinguish between Man and Woman for the ‘marriage’ association. A solution is to add the Person class as a super class and let Man and Woman inherit from Person.
Given that same-sex marriage is legal in most of the developed world, distinguishing between Man and Woman in the class Marriage makes the implementation fragile to changes in requirements. A more robust solution is to use the type Person.
This is actually a really good example of how untested assumptions that we as software engineers make can come back to haunt us later. This could be a good object lesson on the need for requirements analysis.

Eliminate keys rebalance action ambiguity at task 4

Вопрос про четвёртое задание: кто отвечает за перераспределение ключей и в какой момент?
Там есть фраза " В cluster2 ключи, ранее принадлежавшие node1, должны быть перераспределены между node0 и node2."
Но, вообще говоря, эта способность к перераспределению уже должна быть зашита в partitioner, иначе PartitionedKeyValueApi должен поддерживать несколько партиций на ноду.
Получается, что PartitionedKeyValueApi вообще ничего не должен делать для "перераспределения", равно как и Partitioner, это забота тестов?

We have contractors who are full-time, but some of our most senior engineers are permanent employees who are a core part of our engineering team, but work four days a week, so wouldn't qualify as full-timers. It would feel very strange not to include them in our numbers.

Is the data presented in this project free for others to use (non-commercially of course)?
I'm a Software Engineer at Webkite. We develop an application that takes raw data (typically from a CSV file) and builds a searchable website which we refer to as a "Kite".
After @gregates submitted his pull request with our numbers we discussed building a Kite from this data and making it public for everyone. To avoid any problems I figured we should ask before building anything.
Here's a basic example of one of our sites: http://netrunner.flyasite.com/.

Let's make this more than binary

Solved
I'd like this amazing idea to benefit from more than just women:men identities - let's broaden and allow for people to self-id in other categories then analyze the data accordingly.
eg: instead of pulling num_female_eng and num_eng let's say grab num* and chart that so a company could have (and people could make pull requests for data that looks like):
[company_name]
company: Name
num_women_eng: 13
num_men_eng: 92
num_transwoman_eng: 2
num_genderqueer_eng: 1

I could submit a patch for this probably but putting it in an issue in case anyone else wants to tackle this before I get to it. Thanks for doing this!

Distinguish between deleted and emptied files in diff shield
https://github.com/phacility/phabricator/pull/842
Solved
The Phabricator UI uses a rendershield over file contents when the content in various contexts, including when the file is empty. In empty cases, it currently uses the text "This file was completely deleted.", even when the file is still present, but empty.
This change addresses that issue by checking if the underlying file was deleted (or simply modified), and showing the text "This file was completely emptied." in the edge case.

Improve password reset message
https://github.com/phacility/phabricator/pull/831
Solved
The existing password reset message gives terrible advice, in what I think was probably an attempt at sarcasm. Unfortunately sarcasm is often lost on many users and this messaging will at best end up being confusing and create more work for teams that support phabricator.
I'm proposing new default language that keeps the spirit of the original but with better security advice without any sarcasm that could lead to confusion or more work for teams supporting phabricator.

关于个人总结报告
https://github.com/mayinghua/SJTU_SoftwareEngineering/issues/40
Solved
大家好，
有同学询问个人总结报告的问题。这里统一回答如下：
1，个人总结报告的内容包括每一位同学在项目开发过程之中的所遇到的所有问题、所有工作（包括管理、技术、实现、实验）、所有思考等等，是每一位同学所有类型收获的一种汇总。
2，反思非常重要，反思包括项目的失误、个人的失误，以及（如果有的话）对如何改进这些问题的思考结果。
3，对于项目管理的总结和反思，并非master一人进行。任何同学在这方面有自己的想法均可进行。
4，对于技术而言，例如说有同学进行某一个测试系统的实验，这些可以作为技术文档单独提交给我。个人总结并非技术报告，因此请同学务必注意！
综上所述，个人总结不限于任何形式。但可能一份有结构的总结报告会比较方便我阅读。
如有其他问题，可继续询问。

Solved
请每一个项目组在代码之外在GitHub上提交所有你们现有的一些管理方面的文档（可单独放在一个documentation目录下），例如日常会议记录、人员分工、sprint backlog或者其他任何内容。
项目开发在12月1日截止。我会在GitHub上打包下载所有代码和文档。
个人总结的截止日期是12月10日，因此大家有充足的时间来进行总结和反思。这是软件工程最最重要的一个环节，请大家重视。课程评分中，项目评分占40%，个人评分占60%。请记住苏格拉底的这句话：没有反思的生活是不值得过的！这样，我们起码会有10天值得过的日子。：D

通知：第二轮sprint请各个项目的master提交sprint 启动会议的会议备忘录
https://github.com/mayinghua/SJTU_SoftwareEngineering/issues/37
Solved
大家好，
第一轮sprint就快要结束了，大部分小组花了很大力气进行学习探索，所以还没有来得及组织全员参与的开发过程。
第二轮sprint将在11月开始，请各个小组准备好召开第二轮sprint启动会议，启动会议结束后，请各小组master同学向各个小组的repo中提交至少包含如下内容的会议备忘md文件：
sprint backlog；
每一个故事要标记项目组内分工（具体到人，如果有多人分配同一个故事，需要说明内部分工）、以及预期进度（完成时间）
记叙文是讲究细节的，单个故事是小的，小到开发前就可以设想好具体实现方法。如果具体实现方法不明确，说明还需要继续讨论，直到使之清晰。一般来说sprint启动会议会有4个小时的时间，考虑到大家的故事数量少，但大家的经验也少，所以会议时间可能还是需要较长时间，以确保细节讨论充分。

user/{userId} include ownUser boolean
https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/software-engineering-daily-api/issues/156
Solved
Working on the front-end to add public profile for any user. I'd like to conditionally display an "Edit Profile" link if it's the authenticated user's own user being viewed.
Given the current front-end, I'd need to make a call to user/{userId} and user/me which is not a huge issue, but an unnecessary api call.
There are two alternative options here as far as I can tell:
Change front-end to fetch "me" profile as soon as logging on
Include an ownUser boolean to GET user/{userId} to back-end
Further alternate ideas are welcome. This might be a good first issue if agreed to.

To keep all the code nice and consistent across dev environments I think we should take advantage of eslint and use lint-staged with husky to fix linting problems prior to file commit.

Creating "profileFeed" Links
https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/software-engineering-daily-api/issues/101
Solved
I am implementing a public facing profile and would like each user's profile to display the links that they are the author of. See: SoftwareEngineeringDaily/sedaily-front-end#114
I would like to make the following changes to the API:
-add a new object to each user's entry in the "feeds" collection called profileFeed
-when a user adds a relatedLink, that link gets added to the top of the profileFeed list
This is my first change to the backend API so I would love some guidance on what changes I need to make.

add bookmark routes and deprecate favorite
https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/software-engineering-daily-api/issues/99
Solved
The consensus is "bookmark" is the term to use in place of "favorite". We should duplicate all favorite relate routes for bookmark and deprecate favorite.

Change GET favorites/ to return list of post JSON objects

Solved
At the moment, the endpoint returns a list of favorite objects that look like
[{
 "_id": "5a0e0c6ad6b0a2002ad17dcd",
 "userId": "5a021a15454aef0028432711",
 "postId": "5a0d62069e36ee0004c6402d",
 "__v": 0,
 "active": false
}, {
 "_id": "5a0e2534d6b0a2002ad17dd0",
 "userId": "5a021a15454aef0028432711",
 "postId": "5a0c107c41bcad00045a7467",
 "__v": 0,
 "active": true
}, {
 "_id": "5a0e2538d6b0a2002ad17dd1",
 "userId": "5a021a15454aef0028432711",
 "postId": "5a0abf1762969e00041c640f",
 "__v": 0,
 "active": true
}]
But the posts themselves displayed, not the favorites.

get user/:userId exposes user info that should be hidden
https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/software-engineering-daily-api/issues/70
Solved
This wasn't a problem previously, because /users wasn't used in index.route.js. But now that it is, a call to api/users/:userId will return all user info even if you're not that same user or even logged in.
Something that might address this as well as support issues #36 and #56 going forward, could be a toAuthJSON and toProfileJSON functions which would only expose those elements to the same authenticated user and to anyone respectively. Here is a similar example.
Because there is both auth and user controller it seems it would be easiest to put in model but its worth discussing.
As a stop gap - simply disabling the route might be the best choice (my guess is it isn't used anywhere, because the /users was only recently exposed)

Intended use of favorite vs upvote/downvote
https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/software-engineering-daily-api/issues/60
Solved
What's the intended use of favoriting vs upvote/downvote?
I see the use of upvote/downvote as similar to youtube which makes sense. Why also have favoriting? From my perspective, you would have one function or the other in an app, but not both.
Similar but perhaps semantically more meaningful might be "bookmark", which could be used if you want to keep as a list eps to listen to later, eps you might like to listen to again/do more research on related resources. Upvote/downvote would be intended only for those you've listened to (or partially listened to) already.

cloudera is not an easy application
https://github.com/j-delaney/easy-application/issues/118
Solved
Cloudera should be removed from this repository because their application form is long and because the tos are unfriendly to job seekers.
Cloudera's application is long. It is a multi-step form that requires the applicant to manually fill in data about previous employers and school background.
Cloudera's tos are unfriendly to job seekers. Cloudera's tos include an NDA, which job seekers must agree to before submitting their application. The application obfuscates the fact that applicants are submitting to an NDA in two ways. First, the next button scrolls down automatically so the applicant does not see NDA in the title "Cloudera Employment Application and NDA". Second, the application combines this NDA as part of another form possibly making it unclear to applicants that they are submitting to an NDA.

It is not explicitly stated if there should be any technical discussion about software architecture within the Post Mortem Report. As of now, it seems like the Post Mortem Report should ONLY elaborate on the development process, not on technical choices (IE discussing why we chose to use an Eventbus or why we regret using a singleton).
It would be nice if it was explicitly stated within the description of a Post Mortem Report whether technical discussions belong to a Post Mortem Report or not.

Hello,
Firstly, great work on documentation, its just perfect!
I am reading through the datastructure examples and i dont quite understand the stack implementation.
I do understand you are using an array to implement stack. But everytime we do a pop() operation, shouldn't the array element be actually removed and array size altered? Otherwise, even after doing a pop() operation the memory will still be allocated for the popped element.
Some explanation would be great! thanks!

Error linking with -Wl,--as-needed
https://github.com/thorkill/eresi/issues/146
Solved
On Gentoo with LDFLAGS=-Wl,--as-needed, eresi fails to link. The cause seems to be a bad library order in the e2dbg Makefile; some libraries listed there require symbols from stderesi in turn.
I wrote a [http://overlays.gentoo.org/proj/sunrise/browser/sunrise/dev-util/eresi/files/0.82_beta2-as-needed.patch patch] to fix this. You are welcome to incorporate it into your SVN, although I'd appreciate if the commit message would credit me.

Add three new tags INDCONTROL, CONDCONTROL and BRANCH to indicate indirect access, conditional execution and branch instruction to libasm's flags list.
Change uses of CONDBRANCH and IMPBRANCH to a combination of these three flags.

x86 shortjump has wrong operand type
https://github.com/thorkill/eresi/issues/139
Solved
Short jumps should have an operand type of ASM_OTYPE_SHORTJUMP, but end up with ASM_OTYPE_JUMP instead. asm_operand_fetch_shortjump does receive otype == ASM_OTYPE_SHORTJUMP, but ignores it and assigns ASM_OTYPE_JUMP. Patch attached. (I'm not sure why the operand handlers all receive otype, only to ignore it.)

libmjollnir CFG error
https://github.com/thorkill/eresi/issues/133
Solved
there is an error in libmjollnir CFG module, in links.c mjr_link_block_jump function, the src block might be spited, this is not considered, so if the source and destination are in the same bloc, after the spit, the source block should be recalculated.
here is an example
suppose before the mjr_link_block_jump function, we have a basic block
1
2
3
4
and the parameter for mjr_link_block_jump is source is 4 , dst is 2 , ret is 5
so in the function, we first get the block associated with src, which starts at 1, after the spit we have two block 1 and 2 3 4
and the links added is [1] -> [2, 3, 4] [1] -> [5] which are wrong,
we need to recalculate the source block, which is [2,3,4] and the right links should be [2, 3, 4] -> [2, 3,4] and [2,3,4] -> [5].

bin2hex.pl fails to find function name when building libkernsh
https://github.com/thorkill/eresi/issues/131
Solved
it seems that the perl script bin2hex.pl (in eresi-0.82b2/libkernsh/user/symbols/bin2hex.pl) fails to find function name after objdump disassemble object files and redirecting results into text files (kfree.dis, kmalloc.dis, vfree.dis and vmalloc.dis). The script assume that function name is in the 7th line but obviously try to find it at the 6th.
This leads to the unability of building libkernsh because the script never stop. Tried under linux/ia-32 (ubuntu 9.04 with objdump 2.19.1).
I've attached a 'kind' of patch. (I'm pretty sure that the function name is always at the 7th line but haven't tested other versions of obj, so i didn't take care of verifying the line in the patch, but instead i've modified the regex).

Kedbg with SIGABRT and SEGFAULT on static and dynamic modes (ARM ELF)
https://github.com/thorkill/eresi/issues/129
Solved
I've been trying X commands on both modes, static and dynamic, and there seems to be an issue on revm_hexa_display(). Elfsh works with the elf in question and that's why I'm opening this related to kedbg.
I'm sending the elf file and a txt with everything I tried on kedbg prompt, and the backtrace I run after it.
In summary I do:
X .vectors%32
X .data_run%32
Both in static and dynamic mode. The .vectors section goes ok on static but I have a SIGABRT on dynamic, and on the .data_run I have SEGFAULT on both.
The txt file has the biggest output truncated, because it was not interesting at all.

Attached goes a .c file. The parser_test() is exactly the gdbwrap_extract_from_packet(). The only modification is that strsize was a ptrdiff_t and now is a unsigned int. Did this because I was getting SEGFAULT on the strncpy. Execute it and you will see that this function doesn't seem to be respecting the end string when creating the return string... it takes on consideration only the maxsize. Is this the expected behaviour?!

libedfmt fails to load dwarf debug sections on ARM targets

The Pre-requisites on the main page state "You are required to bring your own laptop to the course as the classrooms we are using do not have desktop computers.", which is not true for this year, at least. The setup instructions also need some updating.
Somewhat related to #112, since we need to figure out what to keep and throw away.

In "Replace add-hoc structure with user defined classes", why is the import statement in the class definition rather than at the top of the file?
In "Replace function with a method", should not the abs() function be used to be consistent with previous pages?
In "Replace global variable with class and member" the new code is much bigger than the old code. Obviously the new code is more generic than the old code, but if the only place the old code was used is in the example, creating a new class just to handle it seems like overkill. But of course there may be other places in the code we haven't seen which require this functionality, in which case it makes more sense.

"Replace global variables with function arguments". This is a topic of some debate!

"Git miscellany" page
https://github.com/UCL/rsd-engineeringcourse/issues/75
Solved
In the git stash area of the page, it's not clear what is going on.
From the documentation:
"Use git stash when you want to record the current state of the working directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean working directory. The command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit.
The modifications stashed away by this command can be listed with git stash list, inspected with git stash show, and restored (potentially on top of a different commit) with git stash apply. "
So in the example it looks like a local change is stashed, then the remote repo pulled, and finally the stash applied on top of that, but for new users this isn't clear.
In the Tagging section, the second half doesn't seem to have anything to do with tagging.
In Git clean section, ad brief note to explain what it does i.e. (from documentation) Remove untracked files from the working tree.
Yaml Frontmatter section. The linked page doesn't appear to explain anything.

[Suggestion] Broach common (enterprise) frameworks (Spring/Hibernate) and tools (Atlassian stack/certain Git-Clients ;) )
https://github.com/stevenschwenke/SoftwareEngineeringCourse/issues/1
Solved
Most students have no idea and will never hear about frameworks and tools like Spring/Hibernate/the Atlassian stack/certain Git-Clients (that have free Pro-Versions for students)/certain IDEs/etc. in their entire studies, so at least broaching that subject is quite important.
If you have at least heard of these tools and frameworks or even the concepts, that will help tremendously with finding a job after university.

GitHub Contributions on Profile Pages
https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/sedaily-front-end/issues/480

I was working on getting GitHub contributions up on the profile page, should we create a specific vue.js npm package for this? I was originally thinking about importing an external script, and it seems to work fine, but for the purposes of maintaining for the future, it could be a little sloppy.
Here's a mock-up with this integration:
@joshmorel @dfcook @andrewmarklloyd @jasonify
mounted: function() {
      let gitHubCalenderScript = document.createElement('script')
      gitHubCalenderScript.setAttribute('src', 'https://cdn.rawgit.com/IonicaBizau/github-calendar/gh-pages/dist/github-calendar.min.js')
      gitHubCalenderScript.async = true

Bài tập nhóm - thiết kế màn hình giao diện ban đầu cho dự án của nhóm
https://github.com/truonganhhoang/INT2208-2-2017/issues/82
Solved
Các nhóm thảo luận để chọn một ứng dụng đơn giản, làm lại nó. Gợi ý: dùng các dự án có trong slide số 0, hoặc chọn một số app phục vụ giáo dục, làm lại nó.
Sau khi thống nhất dự án trong nhóm, thiết kế ít nhất mỗi người 1 màn hình giao diện, chọn các màn hình giao diện quan trọng nhất của ứng dụng làm trước, với đầy đủ chi tiết bằng một số công cụ thiết kế giao diện dựa trên bootstrap framework. Gợi ý, tìm trên google với từ khóa: bootstrap mockup để tìm một công cụ để làm giao diện cho ứng dụng của nhóm.
Làm tài liệu thuyết trình ứng dụng bằng file markdown với tên: readme.md và để trong thư mục với tên thư mục là Nhom-<tên của nhóm>. Gợi ý, có thể sử dụng paper.dropbox.com để các thành viên trong nhóm cùng soạn thảo được đồng thời, rồi xuất ra file markdown để nộp vào github. Trưởng nhóm tạo pull request sau khi hoàn thành bài tập nhóm.
Hạn: Chủ Nhật tuần tới 26/2/2017.

deleting placed standard cells does not correctly clean up the logic model

Solved
Open the LP project, select all cells and remove them. Store the project and close it. Afterwards, re-open the project. It will fail and give an error message, which indicates unknown logic model objects.
I assume, that the delete operation does not clean all the nets.

Rails
https://github.com/thebravoman/software_engineering_2015/issues/53
Solved
Вчера, ако не беше спрял токът, щяхме да се заниваме с https://www.codeschool.com/learn/ruby
Регистрирайте се и ако не можете да се ориентирате и справите с Rails, направете:
Rails for Zombies Redux
Rails for Zombies 2
Що се отнася до някакви книги за Rails, аз започнах с тази:
https://pragprog.com/book/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails-4
Но материалите онлайн би трябвало да са достатъчни. Примерно курсовете от горния сайт + документацията на Rails.
Ако имате въпроси, или сте намерили нещо друго интересно оставете коментар (Няколко човека казаха, че четат друга книга за rails, та.. коя? :))

Deploy third party library in AC
https://github.com/istlab/Alitheia-Core/issues/13
Solved
Please document the detailed process that should be followed in order to deploy a third party library in alitheia core as an OSGi bundle.
After careful examination of the other approaches, along with @eligu, and by taking into account the AC plugin creation guidelines, we believe that in order to be able to use the libraries that we need, they must be incorporated in AC as a separate OSGi bundle. But after many attempts the result is always a build failure.
Could you provide a detailed guide about the process that should be followed for the successful configuration of the pom.xml and osgi.bnd files?

Issue Adding Project
https://github.com/istlab/Alitheia-Core/issues/7
Solved
The problem I will describe is actually more of a "wrong" implementation than an issue with the code.
In order to add a project and to experiment with the code I decided to add the Commons IO from Apache Software Foundation. So I specified the following parameters (at Add Project view):
Project Name: commons-io
Home Page: http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/
Source code: svn-http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/io
(All the remaining fields were left blank)
After executing I got the following error (from Logs tab):
ERROR - Error executing action addpr, id 1 Cause:Accessor failed: null

Looking at the stack trace we will see that the problem comes from:
eu.sqooss.plugins.tds.svn.SVNAccessorImpl.resolveRevision line 320.
If we see at the implementation we will realize that the call at:
log = getSVNLog("", svnrev.getSVNRevision(), -1) (line 319)
will return an empty list.
So the first bug here is that we have an uncatched exception, because we call the iterator().next(), method on an empty list!!!
Having some experience with svn and SVNKit and looking at the implementation of method: List getSVNLog(String repoPath, long revstart, long revend)
(SVNAccessorImpl) it seems that you are trying to call:
org.tmatesoft.svn.core.io.SVNRepository.log() with the startRev same as the latest revision of the repository and the startRev -1. In this case, the implementation of SVNKit's SVNRepository.log() will put endRev = startRev, so you are expected to get the latest SVNLogEntry. However the call to that method return no log entry in our case, why?
The problems lies at the fact that ASF has a central SVN repository with a lot of projects there, so the latest revision in our case doesn't correspond to a change made to the path /commons/proper/io (in repo) that is why it returns no log entries. However when we call SVNRepository.getLatestRevision() it will return the latest revision of the repository, and in our case because someone has made a change to another project within ASF's repository all the repo's tree revision number will equal to the latest commit number.
In other words there is a problem with the implementation of SVNAccessorImpl:
If we have a repository with lot of projects we cant add one of those projects to Alitheia. I believe that this is a serious limitation, having in mind that ASF is a very valuable repository of OSS projects, especially of Java based projects (look at Apache Commons).
I think there is a workaround here. Here is the description:
Let say we have a repo with multiply projects and we want to get the last commit of a certain project (suppose ASF's repo). We create the repository object for that project (commons-io):
    DAVRepositoryFactory.setup();
    String url = "http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/io";
    SVNURL svnurl = SVNURL.parseURIDecoded(url);
    SVNRepository repository = SVNRepositoryFactory.create(svnurl);
    ISVNAuthenticationManager authenticationManager =     
                                    SVNWCUtil.createDefaultAuthenticationManager();
    repository.setAuthenticationManager(authenticationManager);
In order to get the last log of the repo we have:
    long lastRev = repository.getLatestRevision();
The lastRev, however, might be a revision that doesn't affect the project, so in your implementation it can not be resolved (see SVNAccessorImpl.resolveRevision()).
In order to get (or let say to resolve) the last revision that affected any of the files/folder under /commons/proper/io we can take all the logs:
Collection<SVNLogEntry> logs = repository.log(new String[]{""}, null, 0, lastRev, true, true);
and the last revision is the last item at logs collection. Or a better implementation would be:
repository.log(new String[]{""}, lastRev, 0, true, true, 1, new ISVNLogEntryHandler() {
        @Override
        public void handleLogEntry(SVNLogEntry svnLogEntry) throws SVNException {
            System.out.println("Last rev (handler):" + svnLogEntry.getRevision());
        }
    });
The last implementation, will avoid to download all log entries, and it will start in descending order, so the last revision will be the first entry that is passed at handler (look at parameters, we have set lastRev, 0). With this code you can easily resolve last revisions in repositories such as this, we are working with. I think the only method that must be changed would be the:
private long getHeadSVNRevision() throws InvalidRepositoryException {
    long endRevision = -1;
    if (svnRepository == null) {
        connectToRepository();
    }
    try {
        long lastRev = svnRepository.getLatestRevision();
        final Rev revision = new Rev(-1);
        svnRepository.log(new String[]{""}, lastRev, 0, true, true, 1, new ISVNLogEntryHandler() {
            @Override
            public void handleLogEntry(SVNLogEntry svnLogEntry) throws SVNException {
                revision.rev = svnLogEntry.getRevision();
            }
        });
        endRevision = revision.rev;
    } catch (SVNException e) {
        logger.warn("Could not get latest revision of " + url
                + e.getMessage());
        throw new InvalidRepositoryException(url, e.getMessage());
    }

    return endRevision;
}

private static class Rev { long rev; Rev(long r) { rev = r; } }
In my case it works, however, I cant say for sure if it affects other components of alitheia because, I haven't managed to Add Project (it can't find a BTS accessor and Mail accessor so it throws exceptions) so I cant Update All and try some metrics (or in the best scenario I haven't any test cases to run against).
*It is very strange the procedure of how should someone can Add Project *
EDIT:
The new implementation of getHeadSVNRevision() will work the same as the previous one if there is a "one project per repo", it will return the HEAD of the whole repo, however if there is a "multiply projects per repo" it will return the last log that affected any of the files under the path that scm.source URL is pointing.

Review of " What Counts is Decisions, Not Numbers – Towards an Analytics Design Sheet" by Earl Barr
https://github.com/ds4se/chapters/issues/124
Solved
Review
Title of chapter
What Counts is Decisions, Not Numbers – Towards an Analytics Design Sheet
URL to the chapter
https://github.com/ds4se/chapters/blob/master/GunetherRuhe/RuheNayebi.md
Message?
What is the chapter's clear and approachable take away message?
Currently, most decisions in software engineering are made intutively. This must change; more decisions must be made analytically; this chapter describes an analystics design sheet whose adoption will transform decision-making.
Accessible?
Is the chapters written for a generalist audience (no excessive use of technical terminology) with a minimum of diagrams and references?
The chapter is indeed aimed at a generalist audience.
How can it be made more accessible to generalist?
Improve the illustrative example with more concrete detail, a point to which I return below.
Size?
Is the chapter the right length?
I understand the lenght to be 4 pages, including references. The current draft is one line over.
What are the aspects of the chapter that authors SHOULD change?
The example would be more helpful if it were more concrete; specifically, if the nodes in the conceptual model were spelled out: the letters E, S, and F are quite abstract.
Copyedits
The following sentence parses poorly.
"This often implies delays in delivering products or lack of quality."
The problem is that one can distribute the gerund over the or,
not the verb implies. I suggest
This often implies lack of quality or delays in delivering products.
Before the bullet list at the end of the introduction: to-wards -> towards.
In the bulleted list,
"likelihood to make" -> "likelihood of making"
"likelihood of avoiding to make" -> "likelihood of avoiding making"
still better would be
"likelihood of avoiding a wrong decision"
The most important types of analytics are the ones least studied by researchers [5].
Citation abuse is making a citation that does not stand on its own, but requires the reader to consult the referenced work in detail to understand the citation. Here, "important types" is vague; why force the reader to read unnamed authors et al. [5] to learn what they are?
AHS -> ADS
Titles are not in title case.
Citations are not nouns.
Gotta Mantra?
We encouraged (but did not require) the chapter title to be a mantra or something cute/catchy, i.e., some slogan reflecting best practice for data science for SE? If you have suggestion for a better title, please put them here.
A checklist for software decisions
Supporting software decisions
Best Points
In seeking to support decision making in software engineering, the authors are attacking a seminal, yet neglected software engineering problem.

Should anything missing be added?
Can anything superfluous be removed (e.g. by deleting some section that does not work so well or by using less jargon, less formulae, lees diagrams, less references).?
What are the aspects of the chapter that authors SHOULD change?
I was not too happy with the introduction -- it starts with name-dropping, which gives it an insider-only flavor. I would prefer a motivation stating why a term like "inductive SE" would be needed, or how it would delineate itself from, say, empirical SE. Also, it wouldn't hurt to define the term "induction" before using it -- yes, I know what induction means in this context, but again, there's a lost chance to delineate the inductive approach to SE from, say, the deductive approach. In that sense, the chapter does not really deliver (yet) on the promise given in the title, but could easily do so by positioning "inductive SE" clearly with respect to alternatives.
Gotta Mantra?
We encouraged (but did not require) the chapter title to be a mantra or something cute/catchy, i.e., some slogan reflecting best practice for data science for SE? If you have suggestion for a better title, please put them here.

I am not sure whether the problem of bike shedding in empirical SE is sufficiently widespread to warrant this chapter; so more evidence and/or motivation would be welcome. Likewise, I am not sure whether the solution of summarizing data into state transitions is sufficiently general to be framed as the one solution. I would prefer having a concrete story (which is currently hidden in the chapter) on how state transitions saved a particular concrete project.

Review of MERE NUMBERS AREN'T ENOUGH: A PLEA FOR VISUALIZATION
https://github.com/ds4se/chapters/issues/118
Solved
MERE NUMBERS AREN'T ENOUGH: A PLEA FOR VISUALIZATION
Very nice concept, I'm in complete agreement on the value of visualizing data, when it's done well. The two examples are classic software engineering tasks that can be helped by appropriate visualization of relevant data.
The presentation in the article needs some improvement.
FEATURE SCOPING
"scope out" sounds strange (to my American ear). It would be much easier to understand if "exclude" were used. For example:
Replace "... which to scope out from the current project."
with "... which to exclude from the current project. "
scoped out -> excluded
I don't understand the phrase "basic average share of descoped features".
The next sentence isn't really a sentence. What didn't happen "until they presented the feature survival chart" ??
Presumably Figure X means figure 1.
But the figure itself is confusing, and the text seems to be confused also. The text seems to have the x and y-axes interchanged. Aren't the features on the y-axis, and the milestones on the x-axis?
Instead of "nuances of green", it would be better to say "shades of green".
The paragraph just above the figure mentions the marked decision points numbered 1 through 5, but doesn't explain anything about what the decisions were, or how the feature scoping affected the decisions. Even in this short overview article, at least a couple of sentences about the actual use of the chart would be helpful.
REGRESSION TESTING
Presumably Figure Y means figure 2.
The picture looks colorful and nice, but without an explanation, I can only guess what the different colors mean. Does the first row mean that Unit Testing was done intensely on about 15 features in V 3.0, intensely on 2, and less intensely on 12 features in 3.2, and not at all in 3.3?

The chapter describes what analytics involves in the software context as well as some experiences using it.
Accessible?

The paper is written for a generalist audience. It does not need to be made more accessible.

Already mentioned above.

We encouraged (but did not require) the chapter title to be a mantra or something cute/catchy, i.e., some slogan reflecting best practice for data science for SE? If you have suggestion for a better title, please put them here.
The current title "Software Analytics in Practice" only reflects the contents of the last part of the chapter. According to the third paragraph of the chapter, it "discusses software analytics from six perspectives [...]. We also share our experiences on putting software analytics into practice".
Perhaps the title should reflect more accurately the contents of the chapter. When I started to read it, I expected something different from what I read. A possibility could be starting the title with something like "Data Analytics in the Software Domain", and then perhaps add something that helps understand better what the chapter is about (essential aspects to be taken into consideration or something like that).
Best Points
What are the best points of the chapter that the authors should NOT change?
Definitely, the last section of the chapter (experiences on putting software analytics into practice) is the most useful one. It should not be changed at all.

Title of chapter
Perspectives on Data Science for Software Engineering
URL to the chapter
https://github.com/ds4se/chapters/blob/master/menzies/dagstuhlManifesto.md
Message?
This is an introduction to this book.
Accessible?
Yes, the chapter is written in an accessible manner, and is suitable for general audience.
Size?
Yes
Gotta Mantra?
Yes
Best Points
Good desriptions about the motivation of this book.
Things to Change
There are several typos in the chapter. For example:
. colloberating => collaborating
. this book explore => this book explores
. data analytucs => data analytics
. we have create => we have created
. All this information => All these information
What is "minute to minute actions"?
About the definition of "products", need to make sure that it is consistent across the entire book.
The second reference is not used?

Thanks all for your useful comments! I will revise the chapter to incorporate them.
Some of the replies to major comments are as follows:
"It seems to me that a person using MetroEyes would still need a fair bit of technical knowledge in order to import data sources, then determine how they are visualized."
=> Our tool can import external data (such as Excel files or SQL database) automatically and determine how to visualize it. Please see a video demo at:
http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/zhith/MetroEyes.mp4
"since the tool still requires someone with a fair bit of mathematical sophistication even to use the graph interface?"
=> Our tool only requires users to drag-and-drop visual objects to perform exploratory data analysis.
It does not require uses to have "a fair bit of mathematical sophistication" or database knowledge...
I will revise the paper to make these points explicit.
"Nit: references to Power BI being in preview should be updated given it is now GA."
=> Sure, will do :-)
thanks,
hongyu

Title of chapter
Software Analytics in Practice
URL to the chapter
https://github.com/ds4se/chapters/blob/master/zhang-xie/SoftwareAnalyticsInPractice.md
Message?
Software Analytics can help eng. productivity, product quality, and user experience by producing actionable insights in practice.
Accessible?
Yes, the content was accessible to the generalist.
Size?
The chapter is a good length.
I struggled a bit with the flow of the sections. I'm not sure why "Research Topic" is in the "in Practice" chapter, it stands out a bit. Maybe if the title clarified this was from the researcher point of view it would be clearer.
Consider less discussion of what Software Analytics is (since it is heavily covered by the rest of the chapters/book) and more content, with specific examples or story, on your experience putting it into practice with the business impact of it to set the hook.
Gotta Mantra?
Nothing is jumping to mind here… maybe something like:
Putting Software Analytics Research into Practice
Help my Software Analytics Research Resonate with Practice
Best Points
I liked the last section on your experiences and "Evaluation criteria tied with real tasks…" (results) and the example it gave. This was a good concrete example of connection to practice.

Title of chapter
Advances in Release Readiness
URL to the chapter
https://github.com/ds4se/chapters/blob/master/rotella/AdvancesReleaseReadiness.md
Message?
There are strong correlations in defect incoming/fix rates to field reliably that can be exploited for predictive release execution and planning, and have been at Cisco.
Accessible?
I enjoyed reading the chapter and appreciated the applied nature of the results.
I'd go ahead and try to incorporate reliable into the chapter title to set more context for the reader going in.
An example chart in the Predictive Test Metrics section to summarize a release in "good shape" or "in trouble" could help the reader comprehend the actual rates, asymptote/GOS, 80% target, quickly.
For the URC - I liked the limit enumeration. One curiosity it left me with was if it covered v1 products. My assumption is results were from mature systems at Cisco.
Goel-Okumoto Shaped (GOS) and NHPP concepts should be footnoted for the readers to learn more about them.
Size?
The chapter is a good length. There are a lot of good material packed in there.
Gotta Mantra?
Ready for reliable release
We predict a reliable release!
Improving reliability, one release at a time
Best Points
I liked the treatment of BET, and making it more useful/actionable to the teams and leading towards NRT value (driving behavior) towards a reliability goal. Business impact speaks. And as a fellow practitioner, I also appreciated the summary

Solved
Title of chapter
Visualizing data is important
URL to the chapter
https://github.com/ds4se/chapters/blob/master/stephan_diehl/visualization.md
Message?
Visualization can serve as a verification lens during data analysis
Accessible?
Yes, the chapter is accessible to the general audience.
An image of decision trees and parallel coordinates can help emphasis "visualization technique can make a big difference" and provide additional info about decision trees and parallel coordinates. Similarly, providing a sequential rule example might help make the exposition more self-contained, e.g., fread should be preceded by fopen.
Casting the pitfalls as headings of paragraphs (e.g., Seeing is not believing, Using off-the-shelf tools, Scalability) in the last section can highlight the message/takeaways.
Size?
The chapter is about the right length.
It might help to add examples to make the pitfalls "stick" more. Say, an example of wrong/right kind of visualization to use with specific sort of data can help the message about choosing the right visualization technique.
Also, since it is a chapter about visualization, it might help to add visuals to reinforce the message, e.g., hair-ball graph vs parallel edge splatting.
Since the last paragraph is a call-to-action to data analysts using visualization, it might help to hoist it as a section.
Gotta Mantra?
How about Verify via Visualization?
Best Points
Don't change the use of decision trees and parallel coordinates in the first section.

[Enhancement] Login screen redesign
https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily/se-daily-iOS/issues/114
Solved
I feel like login screen may need some redesign. I would slightly modify the usage of colors and buttons shape and position.
For instance, when Sign Up is tapped on iPhone 4,7", the cancel button goes beyond the bottom edge of the screen. I know there's a scrollView there, but I believe I could redesign a bit this entire view and implement it accordingly.

Disk doesn't seem to have anyway to update an individual item. It appears you have to fetch all the data for the podcast, update an individual item, clear the file, then rewrite the entire array back into Disk. Is this better than using a db like sqllite, realm or coredata?
Also, Disk doesn't seem to support querying for data based on a predicate/condition.

Problem adding new users and setting up mailer
https://github.com/RedpointGames/phabricator/issues/87
Solved
I can add a new user from the Phabricator web ui, but how can the user log in? Cannot set password, and as the mailer is not working the new user is just unmanageable and unusable.
If I try to setup the mailer, the from the command line using
> docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                       COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                                                    NAMES

...
The settings are gone when restarting the docker, and are not applied before phabricator is restarted, if I am not mistaking. Seems a bit odd that these basics are not covered in "Basic Configuration", or am I way off here?

Rebuild image on Docker hub
https://github.com/RedpointGames/phabricator/issues/83
Solved
Hi guys
Could you maybe trigger a rebuild on the Docker hub so it builds with the latest Phabricator source? The current one seems to have a bug (trying to navigate in Diffusion shows "Undefined variable: view").
Since it is 15 days old I hope this would be fixed if rebuild. Thanks!

Docker images in new location not updated?
https://github.com/RedpointGames/phabricator/issues/73
Solved
Hi guys,
I followed your instructions on the docker hub:
This repository has been recently moved to RedpointGames/phabricator and the Docker image to use is now redpointgames/phabricator. hachque/phabricator will be kept in sync with redpointgames/phabricator for the foreseeable future, so you don't need to update your configuration immediately.
and used the redpointgames/phabricator image, however unlike the hachque/phabricator image (latest
603 MB 41 minutes ago) the new one doesn't seem to receive any updates (latest 601 MB a month ago)?
NB: The new github repo headline also still points to the supposedly outdated image in the docker hub.

Hi there,
i would propose to create docker images of phabricator which are based on the stable branch of phabricator. The github phabricator code provides such a stable branch. So please create also stable tagged images based on this branch. This would be a better choice for production use of your container.

Unable to connect to MySQL using the configured credentials. You must

These standard credentials are separate from any administrative credentials
provided to this command with __--user__ or __--password__, and must be
configured correctly before you can proceed.
So either I misunderstood BASIC-CONFIG or this is a bug...

Hi,
Sorry for the cross linking of issues. I assumed I would need to go directly to Phabrictor to get assistance on an issue like this.
Please see the details here: https://secure.phabricator.com/T11947
I've been using this docker for a while now and it's been working great for my company.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!

git ssh access freeze
https://github.com/RedpointGames/phabricator/issues/61
Solved
Accessing my git repos with git ssh freezes up the connection. After some time the commands are executed correctly. This is related to the problem that the sshd of the phabricator does an rever dns lookup for the connecting client, but the ip does not own a rdns entry. So the phabricator waits for an dns timeout.
To solve this, the DNS lookup can be deactivated for the sshd. I filed a PR for this:

Enhancement: php.ini for less file storage chunking
https://github.com/RedpointGames/phabricator/issues/58
Solved
Some some configuration parts need to set values in the php.ini. But this container does not expose such a file for configuration. A search for php.ini in the container presents two results:
/etc/php5/cli/php.ini
/etc/php5/fpm/php.ini
Which php.ini should be exposed, e.g. with a volume mount?
What i want to achieve, is to configure the upload limit of the file storage backend, as described here:
https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabricator/article/configuring_file_storage/
best,
Christian

This is a significant feature, so probably worth discussing with @TheHollidayInn if you are interested in taking it on.
The backend endpoints for this are already written.
The picture below shows several new features we want to build eventually. One idea for the related links interface is in the center.
The "comments" feature is also there. You can see the web version of these features live today.
AMA is also in this picture, but we are not working on AMA yet.

Feature: Seek Forward/Backward Buttons

Solved
Something similar to this where the seekbar is moved above or below the play button. Then the seek forward and backward buttons are placed on either side of the play button.
I'm not sure how we want to handle icons and such. Do we have someone who can design them? If someone handles the design aspect of this, the implementation would be a pretty good first issue.

It is not possible to scroll through the episode (like starting on 00:05:00)
When you scroll, you end up somewhere like "163:00:00"
Episode stops playing
Pressing play will trigger playing episode but instantly ends playing again. Possibly due to trying to resume on time chosen in step 5

Implement the first function of your group project
https://github.com/truonganhhoang/USTH-SE-2018/issues/72
Solved
A function here refers to an use case, or a user story. So consider:
who is the intended user of the function
what the user can do
the value of the function: what does the user get in return when she uses the function.
Apply MOOC lessons to your projects:
write software specifications of your projects
write unit tests and e2e tests for the function
add coverage report to your project documentations
use lint or other static checking tool to find bugs or improve the quality of your code.
Make a MVP implementation of the function. Here is an example.
Pay attention to your code quality. You can check the quality for example using lint tool.

How is the Rider/Restaurant assignment made?
https://github.com/deliveroo/deliveroo.engineering/issues/153
Solved
Hi devs,
I was just wondering how the process of an assignment of a rider to pick up an order to a restaurant during devliery time is. I couldn't find it in any of the repository, or maybe I missed it. Can someone point where I can find it, or briefly describe it?
I see you have implementations of the Hungarian algorithm here and here, and also of the haversine distance, so my guess is you use the latter to set the cost of a tuple (rider, restaurant) in the problem matrix, am I right?
Thanks in advance

Before the restyle, we had an "edit" link on all articles & documents, pointing to Github's online edition feature, to allow users to easily fix typos or propose minor changes.
Having this edit link was decided as a group (by the 'roo tech leads) so we'd probably want it back!

remove docker installation instructions
https://github.com/uribench/software-engineering-handbook/issues/15
Solved
In software engineering the DRY principle is pretty well known. We should avoid code duplication / copy paste behaviour. Our static code analysers check typically for this anti-pattern. So why would we reproduce documentation how to install docker. It is a waste of energy which we can put in building great software. Also it will be hard to maintain. The documentation by docker is good, complete and well maintained. So I suggest to remove installation details and just refer to docker.

Choose a Jekyll theme for the site
https://github.com/uribench/software-engineering-handbook/issues/3
Solved
In order for the site to be ready for prime time, I suggest allocating some time to choosing (or making) a proper Jekyll theme.
The implementation options are (easiest first):
Just choose one of the supported themes, without customizing anything.
Choose one of the themes, and add some lightweight customization to it through a Jekyll config file, and/or custom CSS and/or layout HTML.
Find a community-contributed Jekyll theme, compatible with GitHub Pages.
Clone one of the supported themes, and create our own, completely custom theme.
Option 4, being the most time consuming to implement, may give us the option to add completely custom elements, such as an automatically generated breadcrumbs header, for example.

introduction-to-python.md: doesn't cover differences between versions 2.7.x and 3.x
https://github.com/se-edu/learningresources/issues/34
Solved
The introduction to Python learning resource article doesn't cover the differences between 2.7.x and 3.x.
As a piece of introductory material to Python, it might be a good idea to cover these differences.
Many beginners often question why there are two widely supported versions, and what the differences are.
(Personally I advocate the use of 3.x, and 2.7.x only for legacy reasons)

TinyTestJ.RunTests doesn't compile
https://github.com/mmbuw/software-engineering-ws17/issues/1
Solved
<Wed 25th Oct>
Running on the console (macOs 10.12.6) the command "make all" it returns an error: "it is impossible to find or load the main class TinyTestJ.RunTests" (more or less, because I have the error in italian) and Juan Cavero has the same error on Eclipse on Windows 10.
Because of this issue we cannot go through the Part 3 of the assignment.
<Thu 26th Oct>
I fixed it! If you modify the Makefile adding the line "javac TinyTestJ/RunTests.java" after "test: Main.class TestSuite.class" it works properly!

Switching loop iterations removes other visuals
https://github.com/ermau/Instant/issues/39
Solved
This is likely due the fact that loops only try to re-display its own contents, which is messing with the ViewCache's internal count. It's re-purposing in-use displays, because it no longer sees them as in-use.

Overflow Exception while editing running code after changing loop counter
https://github.com/ermau/Instant/issues/24
Solved
I made VS2012 crash by editing code containing a loop while Instant is running. The stack trace from the ActivityLog.xml file:
System.OverflowException: Arithmetic operation resulted in an overflow. at Instant.VisualStudio.ViewCache.ClearViews() at Instant.VisualStudio.InstantVisualStudio.AdornCode(ITextSnapshot snapshot, String code, IDictionary2 methods, CancellationToken cancelToken) at Instant.VisualStudio.InstantVisualStudio.AdornCode(ITextSnapshot snapshot, CancellationToken token) at Instant.VisualStudio.InstantVisualStudio.OnLayoutChanged(Object sender, TextViewLayoutChangedEventArgs e) at Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.Utilities.GuardedOperations.RaiseEvent[TArgs](Object sender, EventHandler1 eventHandlers, TArgs args)
Steps to reproduce:
Create this test method:
        public void TestMe(string text, int max)
        {
            // What is it to begin with?
            text = text;
            max = max;

            for (int i = 1; i < max; i++)
            {
                var cropped = text.Substring(0, i);
                if (cropped.Contains(' '))
                {
                    var lastSpace = cropped.LastIndexOf(' ');
                    cropped = cropped.Substring(0, lastSpace);
                };
                cropped += "...";
            }
        }
Click to run Instant next to the method name
Enter in the box : TestMe("Lorem ipsum sefsoe ubsofu beofusbeo fusbe ofusbeof usboef", 20);
and click OK, Should see the variables pop up.
Click left and right next to the for loop counter. Note that the visualisation of code outside the for loop is lost (a different issue)
After the last "cropped" line, insert a new line and try to type "cropped += "test" " , the editor should crash. Note that it only happens if you have manipulated the loop counter first.
My environment is VS2012 premium RTM, .NET 4.5 RTM.

Andy

Multiple variable assignments throws off loop display
https://github.com/ermau/Instant/issues/11
Solved
Multiple assignments to the same variable does not provide any spacing to match up with each iteration.
For example:

    {
        int x = 6;
        x = 7;
    }
}

Foo();
Shows
| i     | x     | 
| 0     | 6     | 
| 1     | 7     | 
| 2     | 6     | 
|       | 7     | 
When it should show:
| i     | x     | 
| 0     | 6     | 
|       | 7     | 
| 1     | 6     |

如何使用 Github 获得学长的帮助
https://github.com/sysu-swi/sysu-swi.github.io/issues/2
Solved
注： 为了减少一些简单的、不必要的提问，培养自己解决问题的能力。请养成『先自行解决，再提问』的习惯，依照下面的顺序获取帮助
1. 先自己搜寻 Google/Bing/Baidu
我校校园网支持 Google 的搜索类业务，具体设置如下
如果已经是ipv6地址，无需配置就可以使用google
测试方式：http://ipv6-test.com/
不支持的话，请使用 ipv4 代理，参考IPv4访问代理
相关资料
* IPv6助力学术科研跨越障碍
* 访问Scholar学术资源的关键：是否已连接IPv6
* IPv4访问代理
2. 和身边的同学讨论
3. 在 GitHub 上发起 Issue 讨论
3.1 在 Issue 板块发起问题，让更多同学/学长/老师看到
发起的 issue 将无法被github删除，请谨言慎行 ：）
题目简要能说明主要问题，最好能描述情况复现的步骤，你描述得越清楚，别人越能了解问题的出现原因，从而越能及时对你提供帮助
3.2 等待他人回复
师兄师姐在有空的时候会及时查看issue并提供帮助
鼓励同学在 Issue 上回复讨论解决方案
3.3 问题解决，关闭issue
注意！
在提出 issue 之前请确定你的问题是否已经有解决方案了
查看 closed 的 issues 中是否有你要的解决方案
搜索
搜索前去掉框内的过滤说明字符，除非你知道怎么使用
4. 发邮件
如果你觉得有不适合公开讨论的问题，可以直接发邮件给对应班级的 TA 或者老师获得帮助。
教学团队联系方式
注： 我们更鼓励使用发起 Issue 的方式解决问题 ( ´∀`)，因为你发起的 Issue 可以公开在 Github 上并保留下来，能对其他同学提供无形的帮助，提高大家的整体效率。

...
temp_data/projects/4748e048/alignment_groups/be796052/sample_alignments/8161ed0d/assembly/{N}
and eventually fill up the disk. They should be deleted in clean_up_previous_runs_of_sv_calling_pipeline.

Custom reference genome exported from Geneious causes SnpEff error
https://github.com/churchlab/millstone/issues/640
Solved
I'm working with Marc G. to analyze the RC3 sequencing data. He created this Genbank which has 2 chromosomes:
Genome with seg19 deleted.
Plasmid containing recoded seg19.
https://www.dropbox.com/s/p7w4w4aeksq2ilg/seg19_DEL.gb?dl=0
SnpEff throws an error on upload (although this is not visible to the user, only in millstone-stdout.log). Subsequently, the alignment / variatn calling pipeline fails at the SnpEff step.
You can reproduce the initial upload error on the server with:
java -jar /home/ubuntu/millstone/genome_designer/tools/snpEff/snpEff.jar build -v -genbank -v a4328420 -c /home/ubuntu/millstone/genome_designer/temp_data/projects/d9521526/ref_genomes/a4328420/snpeff/snpeff.config

            at ca.mcgill.mcb.pcingola.snpEffect.commandLine.SnpEff.main(SnpEff.java:86)
I tried splitting the Genbank into its 2 constituent "chromosomes".
Upload of the genome-minus-seg19 works, as does alignment. Although alignment to that genome reveals strange issues with SnpEff. See gene annotations here:
http://ec2-54-84-165-141.compute-1.amazonaws.com/projects/d9521526/analyze/b121f83a/variants?filter=&melt=0
Alignment against the seg19 plasmid fails.
Can you tell what is wrong with this Genbank @dbgoodman or @woodymit?

Mobile menu breaks when expanding "COURSE ADVICE" or "READ MORE...".
https://github.com/sesa-uottawa/uottawasesa/issues/41
Solved
On the first year tips page if you scroll down to to one of the "READ MORE..." buttons or the green "COURSE ADVICE" buttons and click them, it causes the screen to scroll down and break the mobile navigation.
First off, you can see that the hamburger icon is covering the collapse icon. So the user would first have to scroll down to close the section.
This is not the main problem. If you try to expand the mobile menu, nothing appears.
Even if you close the expanded section and scroll up, the mobile navigation doesn't seem to appear.
I'm thinking that a possible cause for this is that the expanding option moves the collapsible section to the front of the z-index, in front of the mobile nav and doesn't move it back after? Not sure. If anyone has any ideas for this please let us know!

Mobile menu causing horizontal overflow on events page.
https://github.com/sesa-uottawa/uottawasesa/issues/40
Solved
What I mean by this is that the addition of the mail icon in the navigation causes the mobile navigation to be wider. And thus causes horizontal overflow.
Here you can see that the "S" in EVENTS is cut off.
If you scroll over to the right, then you can see that the hamburger icon appears.
If you click on it you can see that the email icon fits perfectly in the overflow space.
Note that this happens only on the EVENTS page. It also seems to happen for most mobiles.

navigation spacing is not consistent
https://github.com/sesa-uottawa/uottawasesa/issues/38
Solved
The main navigation (in full desktop view) has inconsistent spacing. For example, the item "SESA" has significantly more padding/margins than a larger item such as "First Year Tips". I understand this is because a fixed width is being used for all tabs, however I think there is merit in maintaining spacing even if the sizing of the nav buttons would differ. This seems to be a pretty commonly accepted standard and most websites with similar navigation functions seem to maintain spacing.
For an example implementation, check out my website: https://vedpetkar.com or Bootstrap's project website: http://getbootstrap.com/.

Hey!
We need the website to route 2015StartUp and 2015startup to the same place.
So I was thinking of just using an expression like
/2015(S|s)tart(U|u)p/
OR... I was also thinking of just matching any combination... just so they all work
/2015(S|s)(t|T)(a|A)(r|R)(t|T)(U|u)(p|P)/
So.. This might work?
get '/:startupweekend', to: 'SOMELINK', startupweekend: /2015(S|s)(t|T)(a|A)(r|R)(t|T)(U|u)(p|P)/
Seemed to catch whatever combination via http://rubular.com/

the "lets get students to fill in promise" project is specified in https://github.com/txt/mase/blob/master/READING.md
feedback please. still amazed you are willing to do this. the collegiality at this uni.., amazing
fyi, if you want, i could come into your class to brief your students on this
the project has 2 parts
part2 is a big essay
part1 has a seed paper then students work backwards exploring reading one prior paper per week for 8 weeks
the actual "lets add data to promise" exercise is at the end of that sequence. so we dont ask them to do real work that effects promise until after we've trained them in paper reading
for your subject, you could
not do part2
don't walk over 8 papers, but over 4

rm_broken_tests regex doesn't work with regex strings
https://github.com/rjust/defects4j/issues/184
Solved
For the Closure project, an EvoSuite test was generated with the following line:
String string1 = "\\s*(?:'((?:\\\\'|[^'])*?)'|\"((?:\\\\\"|[^\"])*?)\")\\s*";
In the rm_broken_tests script, there is a regular expression which aims to catch all content between the test declaration (i.e. public void testXX()) and the close of the method. However, this string breaks this regex and the method cannot be removed (due to the multiple \ before the " character).
I don't know why the regular expression deliberately excludes cases with multiple backslashes, you could instead check for an odd number of preceeding backslashes (to ensure that at least one of the backslashes escapes the "/' character.
Using the following regex works for this example (but may fail on others(?))
s/([\"'])(?:\\(\\\\)*\1|.)*?\1/$1$1/g;
I've attached the test class and run log to verify the issue.
run_tests.log
JsFileLineParser_ESTest.java.zip
Thanks,
David

I am not able to understand the output files in failing test folder provided in defects4j/framework//projects/Chart/failing_tests
It contains files with number 103, 164, 188, 190, ....2266.
Shouldnt it be respected to version of projects.
Failing tests are which failed for respective version of project and triggering tests are tests which failed and helped in locating fault and when executed on fixed version then passed.
Am i right?
Please tell what these files in failing test folders mean.

How to calculate Source KLoC/Test KLoC for 6 real-life Projects in Defects4J
https://github.com/rjust/defects4j/issues/144
Solved
In the paper "Defects4J: A Database of Existing Faults to Enable Controlled Testing Studies for Java Programs", the Source KLoC/Test KLoC information is displayed as follow:
But for the current version of Defects4j, which is V.1.1.0, there is no relevant information of the source lines and test lines. I am curious how to calculate the number of source code lines. I tried with "cloc" tool (http://cloc.sourceforge.net/) in Windows. But I got different results for different bugs. For instance, I use 'cloc' on Lang_44 and Lang_58:

(18 KloC for source code)

(17 KloC for source code)
And for the most recent version of commons-lang-master (from https://github.com/apache/commons-lang):

(27 KloC for this version)
As the results are different, what should I do to verify the KloC codes for projects in Defects4J V1.1.0. Any help would be highly appreciated.
Thank you!

Mismatch between line numbers in stack trace for Math 101b
https://github.com/rjust/defects4j/issues/141
Solved
Hello,
We are using Defects4J and stack traces in our research and there seems to be a mismatch between the stack traces in framework/projects/Math/trigger_tests/101 and the one generated when checking out the Math 101b and executing the test cases.
I am using Defects4J on master branch, commit 994f0fd
Stack trace
--- org.apache.commons.math.complex.FrenchComplexFormatTest::testForgottenImaginaryCharacter

has the wrong line number for at org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat.parse(ComplexFormat.java:377).
From the test cases execution, I get org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat.parse(ComplexFormat.java:378)

How should I find the corresponding faulty statement for the buggy program (without using fault localization)?
https://github.com/rjust/defects4j/issues/140
Solved
Sorry for my disturbing. I am interested in Defects4j and when I use defects4j command to download the buggy program, I want to figure out if there is a file recording the corresponding faulty statement for the buggy program.
For example, when I download the Time_12, can I know the buggy statement(s) of this bug without using tools to localize or repair it?
Thank you!

Problem about the failing test that occurs in Chart_5 but is not pointed out in Defects4j documents
https://github.com/rjust/defects4j/issues/129
Solved
I have configured the Defects4j on my 14.04 Ubuntu as indicated in the Defects4j README.md. My Java version 1.7.0_80 and I also set the TZ environment successfully.
Then I downloaded the buggy program named as Chart_5 on my Ubuntu. When I opened the terminal in the folder of Chart_5 program and executed:"defects4j export -p tests.trigger", the output was as follow:
Running ant (export.tests.trigger)......................................... OK
org.jfree.data.xy.junit.XYSeriesTests::testBug1955483
However, when I executed:"defects4j test" in the same folder, the printed information was:
Running ant (compile.tests)................................................ OK
Running ant (run.dev.tests)................................................ OK
Failing tests: 2
org.jfree.data.time.junit.MonthTests::testParseMonth
org.jfree.data.xy.junit.XYSeriesTests::testBug1955483
It was really out of my expectation that I got extra failing test named "org.jfree.data.time.junit.MonthTests::testParseMonth". To figure out this, I studied the files including Chart_5/tests/org/jfree/data/time/junit/MonthTests.java, Chart_5/source/org/jfree/data/time/Month.java and the failing_tests file in the root folder of Chart_5. After that I found that it is the code in MonthTests.java:
""""
// test 3...
try {
month = Month.parseMonth("March 1993");
}
catch (TimePeriodFormatException e) {
month = new Month(1, 1900);
}
assertEquals(3, month.getMonth());
assertEquals(1993, month.getYear().getYear());
""""
that triggers the failure of Month.java.
So is it a bug which is omitted by Defects4j file?
I mean, in the file produced by Defect4j, only one failing test is recorded. But when I run the buggy program Chart_5 I have got two failing tests. So could anyone offer some help or guidance? Thanks a lot.

About mutation analysis
https://github.com/rjust/defects4j/issues/126
Solved
defects4j mutation command generates testmap.csv as well as kill.csv for randoop generated test suite for respective version of project.
eg i checked out Lang 1f and generated test suite using randoop, then used defects4j mutation command and got both files kill.csv as well testmap.csv
But when i run run_mutation.pl for Lang project then im just getting kill.csv, mutation.log, summary file but not testmap.csv.
how to get testmap.csv file also with run_mutation.pl for randoop generted test suite...
As with defects4j mutation command i would have to checkout each fault individualy.

A running problem: Can't locate DBI.pm in @INC
https://github.com/rjust/defects4j/issues/125
Solved
Sorry for my disturbance in this Issue section.
Today I install Defects4j as the ReadMe.txt indicates. The relevant applications on my Ubuntu are are in right versions, with Java version 1.7.80, perl version 5.18.2, Git version 1.9.1,SVN version 1.8.8. And after I git clone the Defects4j and run the init.sh in Defetcs4j folder, things are all ok and it shows "Defects4J successfully initialized." in the terminal. However, when I run "defects4j info -p Lang", the problem occurs as the picture above shows. I tried other defects4j commands but they all did not work and encountered the same problem. Hope someone can help me, thanks!

1 Introduction
    The mars climate orbiter was a robotic space probe that was launched into space by NASA in 1998 for the completion of climatic studies, atmospheric and the surface changes taking place in Mars (MCO, 2000). The orbiter was also supposed to be the communications relay for the Mars Polar Lander. NASA launched this device into Mars to achieve several science objectives. First, the device was expected to monitor the weather & atmospheric conditions in Mars on a daily basis. The climate orbiter was also required to record and report any evidence of climate change. Other objectives included an analysis of the water distribution, temperature profiles, water vapour, and dust content on the Martian Surface.
2 The NASA Mars Orbiter
2.1 A catastrophic Software Failure:
    The NASA Mars Orbiter was developed and launched at a time when NASA was operating under the “Faster, Better, Cheaper” philosophy that was supposed to encourage the organization to achieve more objectives with fewer resources (MCO, 2000). The organization aimed at increasing productivity & innovation while at the same time ensuring cost-effective and safe approaches to the achievement of mission success. The “Faster, Better, Cheaper” initiative led to the restructuring of many missions and programs to achieve the objectives of this approach (MCO, 2000). Using this approach, the costs incurred in programs were highly reduced but the infusion of technology and content were increased. This is the background and philosophy under which NASA was operating when the Mars Orbiter was launched. This approach may be a contributing factor to the failure in the greater scheme of things.

This is because, as the implementation of projects using this approach evolved, the attention on schedule & cost increased leading to unacceptable levels of risk in NASA projects (MCO, 2000). Even today, NASA may be operating using an approach where there is very high risk in some initiatives by increasing scope and reducing cost (Stone, 2000). 
2.2 The NASA Mars Orbiter Software Failure:
Reports indicate that the failure of the NASA Mars Orbiter was caused by a catastrophic failure in a piece of ground software. The failure on the ground software led to some discrepancies since this software calculated & produced its results in imperial units while the system that was expecting the results of these calculations was expecting them in ISO / metric units (Hoekenga, 2012). Therefore, the error in the navigation of the obiter device was caused by the software that controlled the thrusters since it was not calibrated in SI units i.e. the navigation device in the orbiter expected to receive the values in Newtons while the computer that completed the calculations delivered pound-forces (Board, 1999). According to Douglas & Don (1999), this piece of ground software may have been inadequately tested leading to the errors that were experienced in the calculations. As a result of the delivery of results using the wrong units there was a discrepancy in the calculated & measured positions of the orbiter which led to a large discrepancy in the location of the device in terms of its expected & actual position in orbital insertion altitude. Even though this was earlier noted by some engineers, their concerns were dismissed but later it emerged that the orbiter was in the wrong position in terms of its orbital insertion altitude (Douglas & Don, 1999). This discrepancy led to the loss of the orbiter which probably crashed in an unknown location. After the error was discovered, an urgent meeting of propulsion engineers, managers, software developers and trajectory operators was called to evaluate the possibility if conducting a trajectory manoeuvre. However, this manoeuvre was ultimately dismissed as the NASA Mars Orbiter was considered lost. There were some responses by NASA following this catastrophic failure and loss of the orbiter. In the next section, we shall consider the actions taken by NASA and the appropriateness of these measures.
2.3 Responses to the Failure of the Software and their Appropriateness:
Immediately after the loss of the orbiter, NASA constituted a board called the “Mars Climate Orbiter Board” to investigate the matter and forward their recommendations to NASA (MCO, 2000). The report produced by the board cited some contributory factors that led to this catastrophic failure. The report noted that the errors that were being experienced but went undetected within the computer models of the ground-based systems in relation to how thruster firings were being predicted and executed. The computer based models on the ground missed the errors experienced in the thrust firings while the orbiter was in its interplanetary journey to Mars. MCO (2000) noted that the software error that led to the loss of the orbiter was not the first error by the software. The author predicts that there were other small errors in the interplanetary trip that were not noted by ground computer models. 

Another contributory factor as noted by the board was that the navigation team in the NASA operations centre was not quite informed on the details of how the orbiter was pointed in space as accurately as it was done in other programs. Further, the fact that the optional thrust firing to raise the path of the orbiter relative to mars was considered but it was not performed was also a contributory factor. The board also noted that the Systems Engineering department of NASA was required to double-check the operation of all interconnected parts but this was not done well (MCO, 2000). There was also the problem of informal communication channels among engineering groups and some personnel were not trained sufficiently on the navigational aspects of the operation. Ultimately, the process of verification and validation of systems engineering requirements and technical aspects of the project was inadequate.

When the software error was discovered, NASA called an immediate meeting of propulsion engineers, managers, software developers and trajectory operators was called to evaluate the possibility if conducting a TCM-5 (Trajectory Correction Maneuver-5). However, this manoeuvre was never done after consultations with NASA top management. After the investigations and recommendations by the board, NASA took some actions to ensure that such a failure would not occur again. In response to the recommendations of the board, NASA has taken some efforts to ensure that the systems engineering team is fully staffed at the beginning of each project. Further, the organization makes sure that the engineering team is in possession of the required skills to work with the subsystem engineers and set up an efficient communication flow. NASA also engages personnel in operations at the early stages of the project to ensure that they have a detailed knowledge of the project. In the project formulation phase, a set of mission requirements is developed early in the project formulation phase, Further, a “through flow-down” of the requirements of every system is done to the subsystem level (MCO, 2000). According to MCO (2000), NASA also conducts system analyses to identify mission risks in all segments and sub-systems in the project. The project teams must also work thoroughly to make “trade-off decisions” that treat & mitigate risks in a bid to increase the probability of mission success (MCO, 2000). A recommendation has also been made and approved to deploy alternative navigational schemes in space missions and “relative navigation” is done when the device is in the vicinity of other planets (MCO, 2000). Technology developments for optical tracking, autonomous orbital determination based on GPS is also being pursued.

The immediate action taken by NASA to conduct an emergency meeting of propulsion engineers, managers, software developers and trajectory operators was appropriate and it may have resulted in positive impacts on the project. However, their resolution to dismiss the TCM-5 (Trajectory Correction Maneuver-5) meant that this immediate action did not achieve any result. I think that this effort did not lead to positive results for the mission since the team did not conduct the TCM-5 manoeuvre. The team should have completed the TCM-5 manoeuvre since it would have had no further consequences on the costs of the mission.

The long-term actions mentioned above will have far reaching implications for NASA. After the recommendations of the investigations board, the actions of NASA to establish a comprehensive engineering team, personnel engagement and training will lead to more costs being incurred. However, even though more costs will be incurred, these actions are appropriate since they can prevent mission failure which leads to even greater financial losses. For instance, the loss of the orbiter led to a $125 million loss. Taking actions such as the ones recommended above will led to increased costs but these will not be in the scale of the cost of mission failure. Their actions to perform continual system analysis, risk identification, tracking technology and alternative navigational schemes are also appropriate but they will lead to more costs being incurred. Similarly, these costs do not surpass the costs of mission failure which means that these actions are justifiable.
3 Conclusion
The loss of the NASA Mars Climate Orbiter led to a loss of at least $125 million – the loss was due to a failure in software. The ground based software calculated its output in imperial units while the orbiter was expecting these results in ISO / Metric Units. The measures taken by NASA in accordance to the report by the investigation board included the establishment of a comprehensive engineering team, personnel engagement and training. Other measures included performing continual system analysis, risk identification, using tracking technology and developing alternative navigational schemes. Even though these measures will increase operational costs for NASA, they are appropriate since they can be justified by the fact that the additional costs cannot be compared to the costs of mission failure.

Test plan for VLC
Use case 1:
User installs VLC in a fresh installation of windows that doesn't include any codecs. User tries to play a file not natively supported by the system and supported by VLC (like a .mkv file). User should see the file being played.
Use case 2:
User tries to play and full screen a video file inside one of the monitors of a two-monitored system. Video should be fullscreened in the same monitor that it was originally fullscreened from and the other monitor should not be affected.
Use case 3:
User drags a supported subtitle into a playing video window and subtitle should be applied instantly.

I have chosen the momentjs library for comparing time between two countries.
I have found a bug according to wrong computing calculating.
http://momentjs.com/
https://github.com/moment/moment/
In this parc I was trying to compare the time in Australia regarding to Iran.
In Australia, the time is changed for DST on 5th of October and on 5th of April.
However, in Iran, the time is changed on 22 of September and on 21 of March.
In those intervals, the difference of time is not calculated correctly.
For instance, in March 26th 2015 at 3pm in Australia, the time in Iran should be 9am, six hours before, however the library calculates 10pm.

The HTML version of the bibliography has some markers for mis-interpreted characters (screenshots). I think this is because BibTeX only handles 7-bit (ASCII) characters correctly; all other characters have to be represented using escape sequences.

ata and Diagrams
https://github.com/Derek-Jones/ESEUR-book/issues/1
Solved
Derek,
I'm a big fan of your work and I'm really excited about your recent release! Previously, you stated that 'Companies just don’t want to reveal how much they spent/charged to writing a software system'. However, through previous consulting engagements, I feel the majority of firms simply don't have any tracking system for this type of data.
I recently released (beta) a SAAS API to quickly create structured data from source / version-control for your own projects and others:
www.scrumsaga.com
While most guides are in Python, I'm trying to produce more R reports:
https://github.com/IMTorgDemo/Reports/blob/master/guideHelloWorld-R.ipynb
I'd really like to get referenced in your book, and I realize you need high-quality data.
The service is only configured for GIthub repos, at the moment, I could provide you data from open-source contracted / paid projects, such as these US government projects, which I'm trying to collect:
https://github.com/IMTorgRsrchProj
While I've collected a large amount of closed-source projects, from consulting engagements and organizations such as ISBSG (http://isbsg.org/), I am not in a position to share, legally. However, I could make an analysis of open-source and closed-source projects and provide you with results (just let me know what you need). In my experience, open- and closed-source projects do not differ as much as people would assume.
If any of this interests you, or I can help in any way, then please let me know!
Cheers,
Jason Beach

Hello there!
I am looking forward to this task, but I just have a few questions to ask...
First of all the MTax class implements the Constant class which isn't imported anywhere, so I would like to know which Constant class it implements and if this implementation will add to the task.
Secondly, the TaxsByListId method is not implemented anywhere so I am just making sure I am expected to create this method, and I am not missing out on something.
Thank you 😄

Specifically, the diagram shows three headings in first level, although it should be only one, and the rest diagram resolution depends on this error.

Setting up small website
https://github.com/AustinTice/JobInterviewAlgorithms/issues/15
Solved
I think it would be beneficial to start thinking ahead and try to go ahead and get a site started. I can try to work on this in my spare time, but if we have any contributors that find their speciality to not be in algorithms, but in web development, then feel free to give this one a go! Please notify in the comments that you are working on something, and be sure to keep updating incrementally to ensure everyone is on the same page with the design. This is not an urgent project, but something that should be in the upcoming future. Thanks you!

Hello AustinTice, I'm completely new to Github, I came across this post through reddit. So I was wandering if I could submit a soluttion to the algorithm FindDuplicate but in Java. I simply don´t know where to write the code. Althouh the code is similar to the one you have in C# I thought it would be nice to also have the solution in Java.

Contribution Guidelines / Style Guide

Solved
I like the new implementation of the README in each repo(#8) , along with the templates directory that houses how each should be formatted, but I think we need to create contributions guidelines page. As far as what is expected when a PR is opened. Things like being sure the Algo Directory is TitleCase, It includes the directory path of the language name, as well as some other nuances we could add.
Let me know about your thoughts on this one @JGFM4

Bug when converting Uuid to String and vice versa
https://github.com/google/codeu_project_2017/issues/62
Solved
In Uuid, ids are 32 bit unsigned integers. As Java does not supported unsigned integers, when converting to a string, the 32 bit integer is converted to a long so that it can be written to a string as a positive integer (using all 32 bits).
When converting from a string to a Uuid, the integer value is not handled correctly as values that would be acceptable as a 32 bit unsigned integer fail to be parsed as a 32 bit signed integer.
If the id value of a Uuid is 0xFFFFFFFF and is converted to the string 4294967295. When 4294967295 is parsed, it will fail as it is not expressible as a 32 bit signed integer.
Parsing needs to parse the unsigned integer and convert and store the bit pattern correctly in a signed integer.

자신이 알고있는 프로그래밍 언어로 진행되는 프로젝트를 찾아서 선택하셔도 됩니다.
(단, 활발히 개발되고 있는 유명한 프로젝트를 선택하기를 권장합니다.)
처음에는 정말 어려울 것입니다.
하지만 읽고 또 읽는다면 이 코드들이 프로젝트에서 어떤 역할을 하는지 이해할 수 있습니다.
여러 친구들이 한 프로젝트를 선택하여 함께 읽어 본다면 더 좋습니다.
물론 과제는 다른 파일들을 선택해서 제출해야 되겠지요. 선택한 파일의 라인 수에 대한 제한을 걸지는 않겠지만 이 과제가 한달의 일정으로 진행되는 만큼 너무 작으면 안되겠습니다.

@tshemsedinov, від студента групи зпі-зп62 Радецького О.М.
Минулої п'ятниці (10.02.2017) я отримав залік з дисципліни "ПП" (оцінка стоїть в заліковці).
Сьогодні мені повідомили що у відомості в мене відсутня будь-яка оцінка.
Де і як Вас можна знайти аби вирішити це питання?

Питання щодо питань на екзамен.
https://github.com/HowProgrammingWorks/Letters/issues/1
Solved
Не зовсім зрозуміло, що Ви очікуєте прочитати/почути на екзамені по таких питаннях:
№ 33. Классификация языков программирования по уровню абстракции
№ 40. Классификация способов непрямого наследования
№ 47. Контексты и управление видимостью в контекстах
№ 48. Оптимизирующие компиляторы и их особенности
№ 53. Глобальное состояние и комбинаторный взрыв
№ 54. Способы минимизации глобального состояния
№ 57. Организация слоя доступа к данным
№ 58. Место кода бизнес-логики, интерфейсов и фреймворка в архитектуре ПО
№ 59. Экранирование модулей приложения друг от друга
Прохання вточнити ці питання. Також прохання додати до термінів їх англомовні варіанти, так як більшість матеріалів все ж англомовні, і наявність ангійської термінології полгшить пошук відповідних матеріалів.

Python print statement/function
https://github.com/pzfreo/ox-clo/issues/24
Solved
Some of the Python code examples show print used as a statement (e.g. print 'foo'), and some examples show it used as a function (e.g. print('foo')).
With the movement to the print function in Python 3, I think it might be good to change all usages to the function version.
Side note: This can already be enforced by adding a from __future__ import print_function.

On the fourth page of https://github.com/pzfreo/ox-clo/blob/master/lab-exercises/01-amazon-ec2-getstarted.pdf, at step 14, it says 'Click Next: Tag Instance'. This should be 'Click Next: Add Tags'.
Also it might be handy to add some clarification at step 22. Clicking 'Download Key Pair' will prompt the user to either open or save, instead of saving by default.

Item 60 on page 9 of "ox-clo/lab-exercises/02-amazon-ec2-continued.pdf" currently reads:
...you can’t disable an ASG, only delete it.
One workaround might be to change the desired/min/max number of instances to zero. Could save the trouble of deleting and recreating the ASG

--> 이런 식이었는데 우리 지금 이러지 않잖아.
지금 다 각자 지효/소공 레포를 공유하면서 작업하는거 맞지? 일단 작업에 무리는 없지만 pr없이 푸시만해도 되는건가 싶어서 물어봄

Неправильна поведінка wrapFunction() у застосунку interfaceWrapper
https://github.com/HowProgrammingWorks/InversionOfControl/issues/7
Solved
Неправильна поведінка wrapFunction() у застосунку interfaceWrapper
Опис
У завданні наведено таку реалізацію функції wrapFunction:
function wrapFunction(fnName, fn) {
  return function wrapper() {
    var args = [];
    Array.prototype.push.apply(args, arguments);
    console.log('Call: ' + fnName);
    console.dir(args);
    fn.apply(undefined, args);
  }
}
Дана реалзіація цієї функції ламає виконання програм, де використовується результат, який повертає оригінальна функція, оскільки обгортка не повертає результату (точніше, повертає undefined) і результат функції губиться.
Пропозиція
Змінити реалізацію таким чином, щоб wrapper повертав результат оригінаьної функції.
return function wrapper() {
    ...
    return fn.apply(undefined, args);
}

Красивий спосіб доступу до module.exports додатку з фреймворку
https://github.com/HowProgrammingWorks/InversionOfControl/issues/1
Solved
Завдання №7:
Export a hash from application.js with multiple functions and variables, print the list with types from framework
Теоретично можна використати require для виконання цієї задачі, але в цьому випадку затягувати прикладний код доведеться двічі: один раз для створення скрипта, а другий -- для отримання exports цього модуля. Більш того, код в такому випадку буде, що називається: "code smells" 💩 .
Як красиво можна отримати module.exports завантажуваного застосунку, який виконується у пісочниці?

È stato riscontrato che utilizzando i browser che fanno uso di WebKit lo script che gestisce la formattazione dei div delle pagine About e Testimonianze (per capirci quello che dovrebbe rendere della stessa misura tutti i riquadri della stessa riga) non funziona correttamente (sovrappone tutti gli elementi del div) per cui è stato modificato lo script per non funzionare con i suddetti browser. Verrà sistemato se si riesce, in quanto è solo un piccolo bug estetico che non compromette l'usabilità del sito.

Creazione DB

Solved
Come richiesto da @klleshi , ho verificato il funzionamento della creazione da zero del DB, nel caso in cui la Regione volesse poi ricrearlo ex-novo suoi propri server anzichè esportarlo.
Non potendo creare nuovi DB sul server dell'uni, ho testato su un server simile (minor release 36 anzichè la 41 del server uni) utilizzando phpMyAdmin.
Funziona tutto liscio. Si sarebbe potuto arrabbiare negli script 2bis e 5, se non ci fosse stato alcun DB selezionato. Ho esplicitato anche in questi file il nome del DB, così è a prova di errore.
@klleshi dimmi se ti è venuto in mente qualche altro problema/test, altrimenti per quanto mi riguarda questo issue è chiudibile.

PROBLEMA FOTOGALLERY- studentesse per la home
https://github.com/InformaticaSaraLei/ProgettoSito/issues/75
Solved
Ci servirebbero delle foto di ragazza mentre studiano che abbiano un formato decente, perchè, come da verbale, dobbiamo inserirle nel carousel della home.
Cortesi ha detto che si può chiedere alle ragazze di scienze ambientali se vogliono fingersi studentesse di informatica e fare le foto con loro. L'ideale sarebbe avere un paio di foto di ragazze che studiano in biblioteca con qualche nostro libro, qualche foto di ragazze con i portatili davanti, e volendo anche in giradino basta che abbiano qualcosa che faccia capire che fanno informatica. Attenzione, bisogna far firmare loro anche una liberatoria per l'utilizzo di quelle foto, che non andiamo nei casini. Più foto abbiamo meglio è, cosi possiamo fare una piccola cernita. Grazie

ReSetting::ARTIFACT_TYPES clone
https://github.com/tmerten/redmine_re/pull/10
Solved
There is a problem in lines 106-107 ( all_artifact_types.delete_if { |v| configured_artifact_types.include? v } ). If you add Requirements module to a project and save settings, then when you try to do the same thing in another project - ReSetting::ARTIFACT_TYPES is empty. I suggest cloning ReSetting::ARTIFACT_TYPES before delete_if in this context.
Failing use case:
Enable Requirements in project A.
Go to Requirements in project A, save settings.
Enable Requirements in project B.
Go to Requirements in project B, list of artifact types is empty. Save causes internal error.

Towards redmine 3 compatibility
https://github.com/tmerten/redmine_re/pull/9
Solved
I made a lot of progress towards getting the plugin to run in Redmine 3.0 with Rails 4.2.1. Replaced now obsolete find_all_by_* methods with where(), replaced :order with a scoped call to order, replaced :conditions with a scoped call to where(), and some other odds and ends.
Unfortunately, this is my first time working with Ruby and Rails so I'm not confident that they were the correct changes, merely the changes that got it to work past a certain point.
Right now, trying to save a newly created Vision fails (this is probably true for all artifacts) with an error that I'm still looking into. But I thought that by eliminating many of the easier problems, someone else might make headway on this.

Refacturing is finished. This commit combienes all commits of the last year to the master branch with the new generalized datastructure for relations. Furthermore many bugs are fixed, so that the Visualization now works. At last the model Realizations was renamed to ReRealizations to reduce the possibiliti of conflicts to other plugins.

I hope to contribute additional changes in the future, but this is my first time creating a fork and a pull request on github, so I thought I'd start simple with nothing but spelling corrections. I realize Artefact is a British spelling, but the code uses both so I changed them to Artifact for consistency.

Losslessly compress images via Picabot
https://github.com/tmerten/redmine_re/pull/1
Solved
Hello! It is Picabot, an automatic GitHub image optimizer.
Your repository cointains some images, and I compressed them for you.
Do not worry: the compression is lossless and uses ImageOptim toolkit.
This bot exists to make the Internet faster. There are people who've got a fast internet connection,
but there are countries where additional 50 KBs take a reasonable time to download (like additional 2-3 minutes).
Additionally, this PR is going to save some precious disk space and decrease your server load. Picabot saves
approximately 25% of space. Still, if you do not need your images optimized, feel free to close this pull request.
If I have enough money, I'll build a server which will send these precious pull requests much faster.
And if I had monthly donations, I would dedicate all my work time to open-source, so donations are very appreciated.
Pull requests, forks and favs are welcome: https://github.com/somu/picabot

后端相关ignore以及数据库的问题
https://github.com/brickmaker/SE-TSS/issues/17
Solved
Django相关的某些东西都应该ignore掉，比如log，__pycache__之类的东西，这些是自动生成的，不是自己写的，ignore掉。具体要ignore哪些，可以在这个 https://github.com/github/gitignore 里找到自己想要的配置。
数据库也应该ignore掉，自己对数据库的改动不能指望别人直接用这个数据库，而是要写个脚本，让别人可以从空的数据库得到你修改过得数据库。

File naming convention
https://github.com/Capgemini/grade-ladder/issues/4
Solved
when viewing the repo, the file names are all too similar, and the relevant bit gets cut off
Also, the order seems a bit random, because it's based on the names not the numbers
e.g. the first 4 grades on https://github.com/Capgemini/grade-ladder are:
Software_Engineering_Ladder-ApprenticeSoftwareEngineer_A1.md
Software_Engineering_Ladder-ApprenticeSoftwareEngineer_A2.md
Software_Engineering_Ladder-LeadSoftwareEngineer_A8.md
Software_Engineering_Ladder-PrincipleSoftwareEngineer_A10.md
I'd suggest a shorter first part, and then A01 etc, and then the grade name

Congrats on keeping the repo active. According to my calculations you've been doing this for 102 days and have missed 12 days. That puts you at 88%. 👍

Wrong use of b0 and b1 in DASE/sections/Evaluation.Rmd
https://github.com/danrodgar/DASE/issues/1
Solved
In #L124-127 of DASE/sections/Evaluation.Rmd "b0" and "b1" are used instead of "b0_tel1" and "b1_tel1"

Directory cleanup

Solved
It's worth putting all of the spawning-related scenes and scripts in their own folder for improved clarity and organization. #25

Worlds should create an array of entities
https://github.com/dim35/CEN3031-Project/issues/14
Solved
Add player to be in the list of entities
Each entity comes from it's own class with the same functions
For example:
Monster Class
move() <-- Some sort of path planning every tick
update() <-- Actually do the move and redraw
Player Class
move() <-- Take in inputs
update() <-- Actually do the move and redraw
Then inside the world we will have:
var allEntites = []
for e in allEntities:
    e.move()
    e.update()

Scene Loader + Make Camera Follow Player
https://github.com/dim35/CEN3031-Project/issues/12
Solved
With PR #11 merged, we need to implement a base structure for scene loading (within the actual game) which will have access to the player stats.
This will require creating a main "world" scene that simply loads other map scenes when necessary
In that world scene, get the player pose and set the viewport to center against the player
